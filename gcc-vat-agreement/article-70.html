                        <li>
                            <p>The Tax Administration in the Member States shall exchange information relevant to the implementation of
                                the provisions of this Agreement, or information related to the administration or enforcement of Local
                                Laws related to VAT.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Without prejudice to the provisions of international agreements to which the Member State is a party, the
                                information obtained by the Tax Administration shall be treated as confidential information in the same
                                manner as the information obtained under the local laws of that administration, and shall be disclosed
                                only to persons or entities (including the courts and administrative authorities) concerned with Tax
                                assessment, collection, enforcement</p>
                            <p>, or bringing judicial claims or determining appeals relating thereto or supervising the above. Such
                                persons or authorities may not use the information obtained save for those purposes, and may disclose
                                such information in judicial rulings in public courts or in judicial decisions. Regardless of the
                                foregoing, the information obtained by the Tax Administration may be used for other purposes when the
                                laws of both States permit its use for such other purposes, and the Tax Administration in the state that
                                provides the information permits such use.</p>

                            <p>The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article may not, under any circumstances, be interpreted
                                in a manner that results in any Member State being obliged to.</p>

                                    <p>Provide information, which is not obtainable under normal administrative regulations or
                                        directives in that State or in another Member State</p>

                                        or industry, or commercial or professional secrets, or trade processes or information the
                                        disclosure of which would violate public policy (public order).</p>

                            <p>If a Member State requests information under this Article, the other Member State shall employ its own
                                procedures for collecting the required information, notwithstanding that the other State may not need
                                this information for its own taxation purposes. The obligation set forth in the preceding sentence shall
                                be subject to the restrictions contained in paragraph (3), but in no case may these restrictions be
                                interpreted as permitting a Member State to decline to provide information on the sole ground that it
                                has no local interest in it.</p>

                            <p>Under no circumstances shall the provisions of paragraph (3) be interpreted as allowing a Contracting
                                State to decline to provide information on the sole ground that the information in question is held by a
                                bank or any other financial institution or an authorized person, or a person acting as a proxy or in a
                                trustee capacity or on the grounds that the information is linked to interests pertaining to ownership
                                by any person.</p>
