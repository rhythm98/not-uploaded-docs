                <article>

                    <p>Each Member State must provide in its Local Law transitional provisions dealing with the following aspects at
                        least :</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>
                            <p>Tax shall be due on supplies of Goods and Services and on imports of Goods as from the date the Local Law
                                comes into effect in the Member State.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Each Member State shall determine timelines for registering Taxable Persons obliged to be registered on
                                the date the Local Law comes into effect.</p>
                
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, should an invoice be issued or Consideration paid
                                before the date of application of the Local Law or prior to the registration date and the Supply
                                occurred after such date,</p>
                            
                            <p>then each Member State may ignore the date of the invoice or payment and consider the Tax due date to be
                                the date of the Supply.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The provisions of subsection 3 of this Article shall apply to Intra-GCC Supplies between a Taxable
                                Supplier residing in a Member State and a Customer in another Member State.</p>
                
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>With regard to continuing supplies that are partially performed before the date on which the Local Law
                                comes into force or before the registration date and partially after such date, then Tax shall not be
                                due on the part performed before the date of coming into force or of the registration.</p>
