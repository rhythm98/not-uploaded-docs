                <p>The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated in that other Contracting State. If the enterprise carries on or has carried on business in that manner, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so much of them as are attributable to (a) that permanent establishment; (b) sales that other State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind of those sold through that permanent establishment.</p>

However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any or its other offices.</p>
