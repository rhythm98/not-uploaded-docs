                            may levy in accordance with paragraph 2 of <a href="#a11">Article 11</a>, by a payment of a
                            special dividend by the New Zealand company of an amount equal to this 15% tax. This special
                            dividend is paid to the shareholder at the same time as the principal dividend.</p>

                            income tax law, if that interest income is paid to a non-resident not carrying on a business
                            in New Zealand through a permanent establishment.</p>
