                                    same time, to clarify that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in
                                    "fishing expeditions" or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to
                                    the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While subparagraph 6(b) contains important
                                    procedural requirements that are intended to ensure that fishing expeditions do not
                                    occur, clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph 6(b) nevertheless are not to be
                                    interpreted in order to frustrate effective exchange of information.</p>
