                            unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent
                            establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the

                            the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise
                            engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing
                            wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

                            executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the
                            permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be
                            allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual
                            expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its

                            management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys
                            lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in determining the
                            profits of a permanent establishment, of amounts charged (otherwise than towards

                            services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way

                            Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may
                            be customary. The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result
