                                <li> Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting
                                    State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more
                                    burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that

                                <li> Stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State shall not be subjected
                                    in
                                    either
                                    Contracting state to any

                                    activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to

                                    such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been
                                    contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.</li>

                                    or
