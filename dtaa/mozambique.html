                            profits of the enterprise may also be taxed in the other Contracting State, but only so much

                        <p>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, where an enterprise of a

                            and dealing wholly and independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent

                            profits of the enterprise to its various parts, the provisions of paragraph 2 of this
                            Article shall not preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed
                            by such customary apportionment. However, the method of apportionment adopted shall be such
                            that the result obtained is in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p>
