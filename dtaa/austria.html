                <p>At the moment of signing the Convention between the Republic of Austria and the United Arab Emirates
                    with respect to taxes on income, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall
                    form an integral part of the Convention:</p>


                <p>Interpretation of the Convention</p>
                <p>It is understood that provisions of the Convention which are drafted according to the corresponding
                    provisions of the OECD Model Convention on income and on capital shall generally be expected to have
                    the same meaning as expressed in the OECD Commentaries thereon. The understanding in the preceding
                    sentence will not apply with respect to any contrary interpretation agreed to by the competent
                    authorities after the entry into force of the Convention. The OECD Commentaries &ndash; as they may be
                    revised from time to time &ndash; constitute a means of interpretation. In case of any divergence in the
                    interpretation as expressed in the OECD Commentaries, a common interpretation would have to be
                    sought by mutual agreement according to <a href='#a26' target='_blank'

                <p><a href='#a23' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Article 23</a> does not prevent any
                    Contracting State from granting direct relief from taxation for income derived from sources of that
                    State by a resident of the other Contracting State provided that such income is exempted from
                    taxation in the first-mentioned State or subject to a reduced rate according to the provisions of
                    that Convention and the entitlement to the treaty benefits can be proved by a certification of
                    residence issued by the tax authorities of the Contracting State where the recipient is a resident.
                    The provisions of <a href='#a23' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Article 23</a> shall not
                    lead to any discriminatory treatment of a resident of Austria as compared to the treatment of
