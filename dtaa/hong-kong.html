              has under the law of the Contracting Party in which the property
              in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property
              accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which
              the provisions of general
              law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable

            <p>The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting Party shall be taxable
              only in that Party unless the enterprise carries on business in the
              other Contracting Party through a permanent establishment situated
              therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits
              of the enterprise may be taxed in the other Party, but only so much
              of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of
              a Contracting Party carries on business in the other Contracting
              Party through a permanent establishment situated therein, there
              shall in each Contracting Party be attributed to that permanent
              establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if
              it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or
              similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing
              wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent

          <li>
            <p>In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there
              shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the
              purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and
              general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Party
              in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere,

          <li>
            <p>Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting Party to
              determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment
              on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the
              enterprise to its various parts, or on the basis of such other
              method as may be prescribed by the laws of that Party, nothing in
              paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting Party from determining
              the profits to be taxed by such apportionment or other method; the
              method adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in

            <p>However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting Party
              in which they arise and according to the laws of that Party, but
              if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other
              Contracting Party, the tax so charged shall not exceed five per cent
              of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of

              cinematograph films, or films or tapes used for radio or television

            <p>The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial
              owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting Party,
              carries on business in the other Contracting Party in which the
              royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein
              and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid
              is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In

            <p>Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting Party when the

              the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting Party or not,
              has in a Contracting Party a permanent establishment in connection
              with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and
              such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then
              such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Party in which the

              the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other

              the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer
              and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the
              provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned
              amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain
              taxable according to the laws of each Contracting Party, due regard
              being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. </p>

              are United Arab Emirates nationals, shall not be subjected in
              the other Contracting Party to any taxation or any requirement
              connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the
              taxation and connected requirements to which persons who have
              the right of abode or are incorporated or otherwise constituted in
              that other Party (where that other Party is the Hong Kong Special
              Administrative Region) or nationals of that other Party (where that
              other Party is the United Arab Emirates) in the same circumstances,
              in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.
              This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of  <a href='#article1' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Article 1</a>,

              on enterprises of that other Party carrying on the same activities.
              This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting
              Party to grant to residents of the other Contracting Party any
              personal allowances, reliefs and reduction for taxation purposes on
              account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the
              Contracting Parties result or will result for him in taxation not
              in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, he may,
              irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic laws of
              those Parties, present his case to the competent authority of the
              Contracting Party of which he is a resident or, if his case comes
              under paragraph 1 of  <a href='#article22' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Article 22</a>, to that of the Contracting Party
              in which he has the right of abode or is incorporated or otherwise
              constituted (in the case of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
              Region) or of which he is a national (in the case of the United
              Arab Emirates). The case must be presented within three years
              from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in
              accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
            </p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection
              appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at
              a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement
              with the competent authority of the other Contracting Party, with
              a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance
              with this Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented
              notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of the
              Contracting Parties.

          <li>
            <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall endeavour
              to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising

              also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases
              not provided for in this Agreement.</p>

              persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies)
              concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement

              for such purposes. They

              judicial decisions, including, in the case of the Hong Kong Special
              Administrative Region, the decisions of the Board of Review.
              Information shall not be disclosed to any third jurisdiction for any

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>to supply information which would disclose any trade,

                  trade process, or information the disclosure of which would
                  be contrary to public policy (ordre public).</p>

              even though that other Party may not need such information for
              its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding
              sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case
              shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting Party
