                <p>7. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State
                    merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or
                    any other agent of another independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary
                    course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost
                    wholly on behalf of that enterprise, he will not be considered an agent of an independent status
                    within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>

                <p>8. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a
                    company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that
                    other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute
                    either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p>
