                    INCOME AND PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION</p>

                <p>At the signing of the Agreement concluded today between the Government of the Democratic Socialist

                    the inclusion of income tax payable by an enterprise which has entered into an Agreement with the
                    Board of Investment under Section 17of the Board of Investment Law No. 4 of 1978, and has exercised
                    an option in terms of such Agreement to have its income tax liability computed on a presumptive

                    granted to it under the Agreement.</p>


                <p>2.1 in the case of Sri Lanka, that the reference to taxation of dividends according to "the Laws of
                    that State" in paragraph (2) of <a href="#a10">Article 10</a> includes the provision in the Inland
                    Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 conferring exemption to shareholders of a company which has entered into
                    an Agreement with the Board of Investment under Section 17 of the Board of Investment Law, No. 04 of
                    1978, on dividends paid within the period of a tax holiday granted to it under the Agreement and one
                    year thereafter. Dividends paid thereafter will be taxable in accordance with the relevant
                    provisions of this Agreement if it is more favourable.</p>


                <p>2.2 in the case of Sri Lanka, that paragraph (5) of <a href="#a13">Article 13</a> has no application
                    to gains from the alienation of shares in a company which has entered into an Agreement with the
                    Board of Investment under Section 17 of Board of Investment Law, No. 04 of 1978 and which are exempt
                    from income tax under the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000; and</p>


                <p> 2.3 it was further clarified that the Sri Lankan airlines being a company which has entered into an
                    agreement under Section 17 of the Board of Investment Law, No. 04 of 1978-</p>
                <ol type="i">

                        <p>dividends paid by that company are exempt from income tax up to 2014 under Section 11(b) of

                    </li>
                </ol>



                <p>Without prejudice to any other Agreement after 2014, the dividends paid by the company will be
                    taxable in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement if it is more favourable.</p>
