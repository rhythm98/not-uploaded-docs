                    <h3>About VAT Refund</h3>
                    <p>Taxable Persons are able to request a VAT refund at any point when there is a credit or when the input VAT is greater than output VAT.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>Purpose of the Claim</h3>
                    <p>Every Taxable Person is required to file a VAT return summarizing the VAT due to the FTA for the tax period. When the input tax is greater than output tax on a VAT return, the Taxable Person is able to request a VAT refund after submission of the VAT return or at any later time when there is a credit owed to them.</p>

                    <h3>Timeframes for repayment</h3>
                    <p>Where the Taxable Person makes a claim for a refund of excess refundable tax, the FTA will within 20 business days of an application being submitted, review the application and notify the Taxable Person of its decision to accept or reject the refund claim.</p>
                    <p>The FTA may notify the applicant that it requires a longer period than (20) business days to consider the application where appropriate.</p>
