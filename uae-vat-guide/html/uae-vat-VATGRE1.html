                            <h3>What is a supply of real estate?</h3>
                            <p>For VAT purposes, a supply of real estate is treated as a supply of goods (see Article 2
                                of VAT
                                Executive Regulations). As a result, a supply of real estate involves the transfer of
                                ownership
                                of the real estate, or the right to use the real estate, to another person.</p>
                            <p>The time of supply rules under Articles 25 and 26 of the VAT Decree-Law should be applied
                                to real estate transactions according to the applicable circumstances.</p>
                            <p>The date of supply will be triggered on the earliest event, which may be on any payment
                                received if that is the earliest event.</p>
                            <p>It is also possible to make a supply of services which are directly connected to real
                                estate.
                                This will be the case where the services are directly connected to the real estate, or
                                where
                                the supply involves the grant of a right to use the real estate.</p>

                                relating to the first supply of the building should be recoverable in full.</p>

                            <p>The ‘first supply’ includes a supply of the building by either sale or lease, but it must
                                be made within 3 years of the building’s completion date.
                                This treatment shall apply regardless of who the building is supplied to (e.g. a
                                registered customer, a non-registered customer, a related party, etc.),
                                provided that it is supplied within the relevant timeframe.</p>

                            <p>The completion date of a building is normally the date the building is certified as being
                                complete by an appropriately qualified party. However, if the building
                                is occupied before this date, the date on which the building is occupied shall be taken
                                to be the date of completion.</p>

                            <p>Where a building was completed prior to 1 January 2018, but the first supply of that
                                building within 3 years of its completion takes place after 1 January 2018,
                                the supply will still qualify for zero-rating. However, this rule applies to the first
                                supply of the property, and not to the first supply after the introduction of VAT.</p>

                            <p>If the building was actually transferred or made available for use to the buyer or lessee
                                prior to 1 January 2018, any subsequent supply after 1 January 2018
                                will not qualify as the first supply of the building, even where the building was
                                completed within the last 3 years.</p>

                            <p>Any subsequent supplies of the building, either by sale or lease, within 3 years from its
                                completion date shall not be zero-rated, as they will not qualify as the first supply of
                                the building.</p>

                            <p>Where a taxable person incurs the costs of constructing a residential building, all of
                                the VAT incurred on the costs of such development shall be recoverable in full on the
                                basis that the costs relate to the zero-rated first supply.</p>

                            <p>The supply of a residential building other than the first supply is exempt from VAT. This
                                includes where the subsequent supply of the property
                                is supplied within 3 years from the building’s completion.</p>

                            <p>Where the supplier of the residential building incurs VAT on costs relating to such a
                                subsequent supply (e.g. agent fees) or incurs VAT on costs relating to the general
                                upkeep and maintenance of the property after the first supply,
                                then such costs are considered to directly relate to the exempt supply of the building.
                                As such, the supplier will be unable to recover any VAT on such costs via its VAT

                            <p>The supply of bare land is exempt from VAT. This includes the supply by either lease or
                                by sale. As a result, any VAT on costs associated

                                Building?</h3>
                            <p>Construction would be considered to be sufficient enough to represent a partially
                                completed building when the stage of the construction has progressed beyond
                                foundation level. As a result, the sale of land where a degree of construction has been
                                completed, but the construction has not progressed beyond foundation level shall not
                                be sufficient enough to classify the land as being covered by a partially completed
                                building. </p>

                            <p>Depending on the nature of the construction which has been undertaken in such
                                cases, the construction may nevertheless represent civil engineering works. As a
                                result, the supply of the land may be considered &quot;covered&quot; and therefore
                                subject to
                                VAT at the standard rate. </p>

                                the erection of the fence and movable structures itself will not cause the land to be

                            <h3>When Is Land Covered by Civil Engineering Works?</h3>
                            <p>Examples of civil engineering works include roads, bridges, and pipes used for mains
                                water or power services. Land will not be considered to be “bare land” where it is
                                covered by civil engineering works which are complete, or partially complete.</p>

                            <p>Land will be considered to be bare land where there are civil engineering works which
                                run underneath the land, but which do not break the ground surface of the land and to
                                which the land carries no right of access. For example, an area of land which has
                                water pipes running underneath it, but which do not protrude above the surface of the
                                land and do not offer any water connection to the specific plot of land itself, would be
                                considered to be “bare land” for VAT purposes (provided there are no other buildings
                                or civil engineering works on the land). </p>
                            <p>Conversely, a plot of land which has pipes which protrude above the surface for the
                                purposes of allowing future developments on the land to be connected to the mains
                                water or power supply would cause the land to be considered “covered” by civil
                                engineering works and therefore would be subject to VAT at the standard rate when
                                supplied. </p>

                            <p>The civil engineering works would need to be of sufficient substance to represent a
                                fixed and immoveable part of the land itself. For example, where a plot of land is used
                                for farming and is irrigated via hosepipes which are run along the surface of the ground
                                and which could be moved or removed at any time, this would not necessarily be
                                sufficient enough to be classified as civil engineering works covering the
                                land. However, where the farm land has a more substantial irrigation system which is
                                fixed into the land itself and is not moveable, this would be considered a form of civil
                                engineering and would therefore constitute covered land. </p>

                            <p>Land which has the benefit of civil engineering works in the vicinity of the land, but
                                not
                                directly on the plot of land being supplied, shall also not be considered to be covered
                                by civil engineering works. For example, a master developer may prepare a number
                                of plots of land for sale, which could involve the installation of connections to the
                                water
                                or power mains within the communal infrastructure of the development, including
                                streets and communal areas. Such infrastructure may run up to the edge of the plot
                                of land, but not actually involve the installation of any civil engineering on the plot
                                of
                                land itself. In such cases, the land is still considered bare land as there are no civil
                                engineering works on the land being supplied. </p>

                                as a farm e.g. irrigation systems, roads, utility connections etc. It will be necessary,
                                however, to assess each supply of land on a case by case basis to confirm whether it
                                meets the definition of bare land or covered land.

                            <p>It may be the case that a landlord supplies land to a tenant which meets the definition
                                of “bare land” at the point it is first leased to the tenant, however once the tenant
                                begins
                                to develop on the land then the nature of the landlord’s supply will change. </p>


                            <p>As soon as the land becomes covered by completed or partially completed buildings
                                or civil engineering works, the land ceases to be bare land. Where the date of supply
                                has already been triggered for the bare land, no adjustment is required to the VAT
                                treatment at this point. However, if the landlord makes any further supply of the land
                                (for example, if the parties enter into a new lease agreement or if the supply is
                                treated
                                as made periodically under Article 26 of the Decree-Law), the landlord should charge
                                VAT at the standard rate to the tenant since it would not be making a supply of bare
                                land. This is likely to require a degree of commercial cooperation between the landlord
                                and the tenant, in order to identify and communicate on a timely basis the point in time
                                at which the land ceases to be bare. </p>

                            <p>For example, a tenant may sign a 10-year lease for a bare plot of land in June 2018,
                                with dates of supply being triggered under Article 26 of the Decree-Law on a monthly
                                basis. The tenant then begins preparing the land for construction and then
                                development subsequently commences on the land in September 2018. The tenant
                                must notify the landlord that the land is no longer considered as ‘bare land’ due to the
                                construction and/or civil engineering works. The supply of land, which was previously
                                treated as exempt from VAT, must be treated as standard-rated for the remainder of
                                the lease. </p>

                            <p>In contrast, if, for example, the parties enter into a one-off 10-year lease with the
                                date
                                of supply triggered under Article 25 of the Decree-Law (e.g. by a full payment prior to
                                the lease commencing), no adjustment of the VAT treatment is required if the land
                                ceases to be bare part-way through the lease. </p>

                            <p>It is acknowledged that registered Musataha agreements differ from short and
                                medium-term leases. Consequently, in instances where the parties enter into a
                                Musataha agreement which is registered with the appropriate Land Department or
                                Municipality as required under UAE property law, the lease agreement will be treated
                                the same as a contract of sale or one-off lease and no adjustment to the VAT treatment
                                would be required after that date. If the Musataha is not registered, the lease will
                                generally be treated the same as any other lease agreement. If the contracting parties
                                are unable to register the Musataha agreement due to circumstances beyond their
                                control (as evidenced by the relevant Land Department or Municipality), the parties may
                                request a clarification to confirm whether the agreement could, for VAT purposes,
                                still be regarded as similar to a sale agreement or whether the normal rules for leasing
                                would apply.</p>

                            <p>For example, a landlord leases a bare plot of land to a tenant under a 50-year
                                Musataha agreement which is registered with the applicable government authority and
                                consideration is to be settled via the following instalments: 50% of the consideration
                                paid upon the signing of the agreement, 30% paid at the end of the fifth year and the
                                remaining 20% shall be paid at the end of the tenth year. At the end of the fourth year,
                                the tenant started a development project, and changed the bare land to developed
                                land. Although there are three instalments being paid over the first ten years of the
                                lease period, the supply would not qualify as a continuous supply. The VAT treatment
                                shall follow the nature of the land at the time when the date of supply takes place
                                (i.e.
                                supply of bare land which exempt from VAT). </p>

                            <p>The supply of commercial real estate is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 5%.</p>
                            <p>The supply of commercial real estate includes sale or lease. VAT is therefore due on the
                                total consideration received for the supply of commercial real estate.
                                Where the consideration for the supply is payable by instalment, VAT will be due on each
                                instalment paid.</p>
                            <p>As a result of making a taxable supply of commercial real estate, any VAT on costs
                                incurred in relation to the supply shall be recoverable in full.</p>

                            <h3>Cancelled Developments</h3>
                            <p>Where a supplier accepts full or partial payment in relation to a supply of real estate
                                and the supply is subsequently cancelled, for example where the planned
                                development is cancelled and does not take place, the supplier will normally be required
                                to refund the money paid to the customer.</p>
                            <p>Where this is the case, the supplier should issue a tax credit note to the customer in
                                order to refund the consideration previously paid in respect of the supply.
                                The tax credit note will have the effect of reversing the output tax which the supplier
                                will have originally accounted for on the receipt of the payment.</p>
                            <p>In the event the supplier is not required to refund the amount paid to the customer, it
                                will be necessary for the supplier to establish the reason he is entitled
                                to retain the money in order to determine the VAT treatment. Where the retained payment
                                is treated as consideration for a supply of services by the supplier,
                                it will remain subject to VAT at the standard rate and there will not be a requirement
                                for the supplier to issue a tax credit note.</p>

                            <h3>Payment of VAT on Sales of Commercial Real Estate</h3>
                            <p>A special payment process exists where sales of commercial real estate are made within
                                the UAE. Detailed guidance on this process can be found in the VAT Payment
                                for Commercial Property Buyers User Guide, however the process is also summarised in
                                this guide below.</p>
                            <p>The special payment process applies only in the case where commercial real estate is sold
                                in the UAE by any supplier other than the developer of that property,
                                and would be subject to VAT at 5%. Therefore, it does not apply to the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Sales or leases of residential property;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Leases of commercial property</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Sales of commercial property by the developer of that property; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The sale of commercial property with the benefit of existing tenants to a buyer
                                        who is a taxable person which qualifies as the transfer of a business.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In such cases, the seller of the property will issue a tax invoice to the buyer in
                                relation to the sale proceeds of the property as normal. However, before completing the
                                ownership transfer process with the Land Department, the buyer of the commercial
                                property will be required to pay the VAT due on the purchase directly to the FTA.
                                Alternatively, subject to availability in the specific Emirate, the VAT may be paid via
                                a bank nominated by the FTA for such purposes.</p>
                            <p>Once the payment of the VAT has been made to the FTA, the buyer will receive a Payment
                                Transaction Number or, in the case of a bank payment, the buyer will need
                                to retain proof of payment containing the details of the VAT payment.</p>
                            <p>The buyer will be required to produce the Payment Transaction Number or proof of payment
                                (if applicable) to the Land Department in order to process the ownership
                                transfer. Without this evidence that the VAT on the purchase has been paid, the purchase
                                of the property cannot proceed and this will lead to delays.</p>
                            <p>The supplier will declare the output tax due on the property within its VAT return in the
                                normal way, and will then also include the value of the output tax in the
                                adjustments column of the return. This will avoid paying the output tax to the FTA
                                twice.</p>
                            <p>In all other cases, the normal VAT rules regarding VAT accounting and payment are
                                applicable.</p>

                            <h3>What is a mixed-use development?</h3>
                            <p>A mixed-use development is a building or plot of land which has clear and distinct areas
                                which are put to different uses which would have a different VAT treatment when
                                supplied. For example, a building which has retail units on the ground floor level,
                                office or commercial space on the middle floors of the building and residential units on
                                the
                                top floor would be considered a mixed-use development.</p>
                            <p>Where a distinct part of a mixed-use development is supplied, the VAT liability
                                applicable to the supply shall depend on the use of the part of the building which is
                                being supplied
                                i.e. the supply of a commercial unit shall be taxable at the standard rate, whilst the
                                supply of a residential unit (other than the first supply) shall be exempt from VAT.</p>
                            <p>Where a mixed use-development is sold in its entirety, it shall be necessary to apportion
                                the consideration received between the different parts of the building. The value of
                                consideration relating to the residential part of the building shall be treated as
                                exempt from VAT (or zero-rated, where the supply is the first supply), and the value of
                                consideration relating to the commercial part of the building shall be treated as
                                standard rated.</p>

                            <p>Input tax incurred on the development cost of new commercial real estate is recoverable
                                in full, given that supplies of that building shall be taxable. This means that
                                developers
                                will be able to recover VAT over the duration of the development of the building.</p>
                            <p>Where a taxable person incurs the costs of constructing a residential building, all of
                                the VAT incurred on the costs of such development shall be recoverable in full on the
                                basis that the costs relate to the zero-rated first supply. Any future supplies of the
                                building by that taxable person (e.g. a subsequent lease, which would be exempt from VAT
                                after the first supply) shall be ignored for the purposes of input tax recovery.</p>

                            <p>Input tax incurred on the repair and maintenance costs of a property which is used for
                                wholly commercial purposes is recoverable in full.</p>
                            <p>Input tax incurred on the repairs and maintenance of a property which is used for wholly
                                residential purposes is not recoverable.</p>
                            <p>Where input tax is incurred on a property which is used for both commercial and
                                residential purposes, the taxpayer is required to directly attribute the VAT on costs
                                incurred as far as reasonably possible. For example, where a building contains retail
                                shops and residential apartments, any costs incurred which directly relate to the shops
                                can be recovered in full. However, any costs which directly relate to the residential
                                properties are not recoverable. This then leaves an amount of input tax, often called
                                residual input tax, where the cost is used for both parts of the business e.g. roof
                                repairs.</p>

                            <p>The input tax must be apportioned in accordance with the following method:</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>
                                    <p>Input Tax that relates wholly to supplies where input tax is recoverable (e.g.
                                        taxable supplies), is recoverable in full;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Input Tax that relates wholly to supplies where the input tax is non-recoverable
                                        (e.g. exempt and non-business supplies), is blocked in full;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Input tax that cannot be allocated under (a) or (b) above (e.g. roof repairs)
                                        must be apportioned, and is known as “residual input tax”.</p>
                                </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The residual input tax identified under point c) above should be apportioned using
                                    the following method:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Recoverable Tax % = supplies falling within paragraph (a) above / supplies
                                            falling within paragraph (a) + supplies falling within paragraph (b);</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The percentage calculated under paragraph (1) above is then rounded to the
                                            nearest whole number;</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The percentage calculated under paragraph (2) is to be multiplied by the
                                            amount of input tax referred to in paragraph (c) to establish the
                                            recoverable proportion
                                            of that input tax;</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The total recoverable input tax is then the sum of supplies falling within
                                            paragraph (a) plus the answer under paragraph (3).</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>The standard method of apportionment set out above may not be appropriate in every
                                    situation. Each business is different, and the standard method of apportionment may
                                    give rise to outcomes which might not be reflective of the actual use of goods or
                                    services by the business. As a consequence, the FTA introduced alternative methods
                                    of
                                    input tax apportionment which may be used where the standard method does not provide
                                    an outcome which is reflective of the actual use of the acquired goods or services.
                                    A special method may however only be used after written approval was received from
                                    the FTA.</p>

                                <p>The floorspace method is available to businesses which deal with supplies (sales and
                                    rental) of commercial and residential properties, including real estate companies
                                    and
                                    other businesses which sell or rent out real estate on an ongoing basis, where
                                    expenses would be similar for floorspace regardless of whether used for making
                                    exempt or
                                    taxable supplies. Under the floorspace method, the apportionment percentage for
                                    residual input tax is calculated by identifying the portion of the floorspace used
                                    for taxable
                                    activity as a percentage of the total floorspace used by the business. </p>

                            <h3>What is an Owner’s Association or a Management Entity?</h3>
                            <p>Owners’ associations (“OA’s”) or Management Entities(“ME’s”) are often established to
                                manage and administer the common areas of a building on behalf of all of the
                                owners of a building. They commonly deal with issues such as cleaning, maintenance,
                                security etc. OA’s are often comprised of members which are the owners of the
                                individual units themselves, while ME’s may include the developer, the management
                                company, or the hotel project management company as the case may be.</p>
                            <p>An OA/ME is normally responsible for the procurement of services required to maintain the
                                upkeep of the property and collects money from all of the owners of the individual
                                units within a property in order to pay the expenses of contractors or fund major
                                refurbishment works.</p>
                            <p>OA’s are usually not-for-profit organisations or associations, but they can take many
                                different legal forms. They are not normally incorporated legal entities, but instead
                                they could be:</p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>An OA/ME is regarded as a ‘person’ for VAT purposes and required to register for VAT if
                                its supplies exceed the VAT registration threshold. Although OA’s and MEs can
                                take many different legal forms and can enter into arrangements with suppliers and
                                tenants, in multiple different ways, they will be making taxable supplies or undertaking
                                an economic activity and the normal VAT rules will apply.</p>
                            <p>An OA/ME will therefore be required to register for VAT where any of the following

                            <p>The VAT liability of supplies may vary depending on the nature of the supply made by the
                                OA/ME. In cases where the OA/ME is conducting an economic activity and has
                                the ability to register for VAT, any service charges made by the OA/ME should be subject
                                to VAT at 5%.</p>
                            <p>As a result of charging VAT on the service charges, the OA/ME should therefore have the
                                right to recover any VAT incurred on services it purchases from third parties for
                                the purposes of maintaining the building.</p>

                            <p>In many cases in the UAE a master developer will purchase a large plot of land, which it
                                then sub-divides into smaller plots of land for sale.
                                As part of this process, the master developer will add infrastructure to the communal
                                areas of the development, such as roads, power and water,
                                and connections to other infrastructure such as internet and phone lines. In some cases,
                                such infrastructure costs may include the development of
                                mosques, parks, utility networks and landscaping etc. This work is often required as a
                                condition of the Urban Planning Authorities in order to approve
                                the master plan and allow the master developer to sell the divided plots.</p>

                            <h3>VAT recovery on infrastructure costs</h3>
                            <p>Where a master developer incurs VAT in the course of constructing communal infrastructure
                                on a large plot of land, such costs have been incurred in
                                the normal course of the master developer’s business. As such, the VAT on such costs
                                should be recoverable as a general overhead cost of the business.</p>
                            <p>Where the business makes fully taxable supplies, the VAT incurred on the infrastructure
                                costs shall therefore be recoverable in full. However, where the
                                smaller plots of land in the master community are sold as bare land they shall be exempt
                                from VAT, with no right to recover any VAT. This would only
                                apply where the land remained bare land and any plots sold are sold as bare land, but
                                nevertheless, the land had separate infrastructure (e.g. a road)
                                which is not part of the sale of ‘bare land’.</p>
                            <p>In the event that a mixture of bare land and commercial real estate is sold from the
                                site, then the VAT incurred on infrastructure costs should be
                                apportioned under the normal input tax apportionment rules.</p>

                            <p>Where a landlord pays a prospective tenant to enter into a lease, the tenant is
                                considered to be making a supply to the landlord of agreeing to enter into a contract.
                                If the tenant is registered for VAT then their services shall be subject to VAT at 5%,
                                regardless of whether the property is a commercial or residential property.</p>
                            <p>Where the prospective tenant is not VAT registered any inducement paid by the landlord is
                                outside the scope of VAT.</p>
                            <p>In addition, any inducements paid by a tenant to a third party to accept the assignment
                                of a lease is not consideration for the assignment or grant, but is a standard-rated
                                supply of services by the third party.</p>

                            <h3>Rent-free periods</h3>
                            <p>Where the landlord grants a rent-free period in return for no consideration, the
                                rent-free period does not normally constitute a supply for VAT purposes. This is only
                                the
                                case where the tenant is not obliged or required to provide anything in return, and the
                                tenant is not a related party.</p>
                            <p>However, if a tenant undertakes to provide anything to the landlord in return for the
                                rent-free period, this would represent a barter transaction. For example, a landlord
                                may grant a rent-free period to a tenant in return for the tenant agreeing to refurbish
                                the property. In such cases, both supplies will be of equal value, but will not
                                necessarily
                                have the same VAT liability (for example, where the landlord is supplying residential
                                property). Where VAT is charged on the value of the barter transaction this would be
                                recoverable subject to the normal rules.</p>
                            <p>In some cases, a landlord may advertise to a tenant that he is providing a rent-free
                                period, when in fact he is simply agreeing to collect the rent over a shorter period
                                than
                                the lease term. For example, the landlord may grant a 12-month lease stating that the
                                first month is rent-free, with the rent payable over the remaining 11 months of the
                                lease
                                term. The VAT liability of the rent received is the total consideration received and
                                remains the same, whether or not a rent-free period is offered.</p>

                                licence to occupy land, then that is a supply to the landlord by the tenant. The tenant

                                considered to be making a supply of agreeing to exit the lease early and if the tenant
                                is registered for VAT then their services shall be subject to VAT at 5%. This is
                                regardless of whether the property is a commercial or residential property.</p>

                            <p>Variations to leases may simply alter one or more of the terms, such as permitting the
                                building to be used for a purpose that was originally prohibited. </p>

                            <p>However, other
                                variations to a lease can be more fundamental, such as an extension to the length of the
                                tenancy or an alteration to a demised area. Where there is a more
                                fundamental change to the lease, the old lease is treated as surrendered and a new lease
                                granted in its place. Any consideration the landlord receives for any type of
                                lease variation is taxable at 5% on the basis that the landlord is making a supply of
                                agreeing to vary the lease terms.</p>
                            <p>However, where there is no monetary consideration, no supply is seen as taking place if

                            <p>Depending on the terms of the contract, dilapidation payments which are paid as damages

                                the tenant and which will be undertaken by the landlord, the payment involved is the
                                consideration for a supply for VAT purposes and is subject to VAT at 5%.</p>

                            <p>It is important to establish the place of supply of goods or services in order that the
                                supplier can confirm whether or not UAE VAT will be applicable to the transaction.</p>
                            <p>The supply of real estate including sale and tenancy contracts is a supply of goods. The
                                place of supply of goods is the UAE, where the goods are located in the UAE
                                when sold and the supply does not involve the export of goods from the UAE.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, any real estate located in the UAE (except property located in a Designated
                                Zone) is supplied in the UAE. As a result, the supply of any property located in
                                the UAE will be subject to UAE VAT legislation.</p>

                                supply of the services is where the real estate is located. Therefore, any services

                                make up the supply. If there are multiple supplies each will need to be considered on

                            <p>The VAT registration threshold for non-residents who make taxable supplies in the UAE is
                                nil.</p>
                            <p>As noted above, supplies of real estate are considered to be supplies of goods. Real
                                estate located within the UAE is therefore subject to VAT in the UAE where applicable.
                            </p>
                            <p>Where a non-resident landlord makes any taxable supplies related to any real estate
                                located in the UAE, they will be required to register, charge and account for VAT.</p>
                            <p>It is not possible for non-resident landlords to make use of the reverse charge mechanism
                                where their tenant is already VAT registered in the UAE, on the basis that
                                the reverse charge mechanism is applicable only in respect of the import of concerned
                                goods and on services received from non-resident suppliers. Given that real
                                estate is a supply of goods, and is already located within the UAE so cannot be
                                imported, the reverse charge mechanism is not applicable.</p>
                            <p>Where the real estate itself is sufficient enough to create a fixed establishment for the
                                non-resident landlord, it shall be considered resident in the UAE and therefore subject
                                to the mandatory registration threshold and eligible to be a member of a VAT group.</p>
                            <p>In order for the real estate to create a fixed establishment for the landlord, there
                                would normally need to be sufficient human and technical resource located within the
                                UAE in order for the landlord to make the supply of the real estate.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned above, supplies of real estate, which include sale and lease of real estate,
                                are treated as supplies of goods and the place of supply of such supplies is
                                where the real estate is located.</p>
                            <p>VATG203 confirms that these supplies of real estate made within Designated Zones will be
                                outside the scope of VAT, subject to the conditions attaching to supplies of
                                goods within Designated Zones. It should be noted real estate will not be treated as
                                being “consumed” when sold or leased within a Designated Zone to another business
                                to be used by that business – and therefore such supply of real estate is eligible to be
                                treated as outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p>
                            <p>All other supplies of real estate are deemed to be supplies of services related to real
                                estate. This includes, but is not limited to licences to occupy, and other contractual
                                rights which are exercisable over or in relation to real estate.</p>
                            <p>The supply of services also includes the provision, lease and rental of sleeping
                                accommodation in a hotel or similar establishment, services of real estate experts or
                                estate agents, and construction and similar services.</p>
                            <p>As a result, supplies of services related to real estate which are outlined above and
                                performed in the Designated Zone will be liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>

                            <p>The normal date of supply rules apply to construction services in the same way as they
                                apply to any other service i.e. the date of supply will generally be the earlier date
                                of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Receipt of payment;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Completion of the services; or</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>A tax invoice is issued in respect of the supply.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>However, in practice the construction industry involves supplies which take place over
                                a significant period of time and are therefore subject to stage of completion
                                payments/advance payments/retentions etc and other performance-related events
                                during the course of the overall supply. As a result, applying the above date of supply
                                rules may not always be straightforward for supplies within the construction industry
                                and therefore special rules apply for the services which are supplied on a continuous
                                or on-going basis over a period of time – these are often known as continuous supplies
                                of services and apply to construction services where there are periodic payments or
                                consecutive invoices. The rules for this are found in Article 26 of the Decree-Law. </p>
                            <p>A supply is considered to fall under these rules where both factually and contractually
                                there are multiple payments to be made under the contract – so for example,
                                provisions for an advance payment and/or a stage of completion payment(s) and
                                retentions would mean a supply was considered to fall under these rules.</p>
                            <p>In such cases where a contract includes periodic payments or consecutive invoices,
                                the date of supply shall be the earliest of the following:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The date of issuance of any tax invoice; </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The date payment is due as shown on the tax invoice;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The date of receipt of payment.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In the event that 12 months has passed from the date of provision of the goods or
                                services and none of the above events has occurred, a date of supply will be triggered
                                at the 12-month point.</p>

                            <p>The certification of a construction project at a particular point in time will not
                                trigger the
                                date of supply for VAT purposes. However, certification of a project is often linked to
                                other obligations such as a due date for payment, which may itself trigger the date of
                                supply.</p>

                            <h3>Retention payments</h3>
                            <p>It is often the case where large construction projects are concerned that a retention
                                clause will be included within the contract. A retention clause allows the customer to
                                hold back a proportion of the contract price once the work has been completed,
                                pending confirmation that the supplier has done the work properly and has rectified
                                any immediate faults that might be found. </p>

                            <p>Often the retention amount is not payable by the customer until an agreed period of
                                time has passed, and in some cases where the customer is not satisfied with the
                                quality of the work, the retention payment will be retained by the customer. </p>

                            <p>There are no special rules for determining the date of supply in relation to retention
                                payments, therefore the normal relevant date of supply rules must apply – in other
                                words those applying to continuous supplies under Article 26 of the Decree-Law.</p>

                            <p>Under Article 26 of the Decree Law, the date of supply shall therefore be triggered at
                                the earliest of: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The time the retention payment has been made;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The issuance of a tax invoice in relation to the retention; or</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>12 months from the date the work has been signed off as complete (e.g.
                                        certified).</p>
                                </li>

                            </ul>


                            <p>If, however, the services are considered to be a single supply subject to the tax point
                                rules under Article 25 of the Decree-Law, and the services are considered to have
                                already been completed by the supplier (e.g. they have been certified), the date of
                                supply for the retention will be triggered on the date the services were completed (or
                                on the date of issue of the tax invoice or receipt of payment if earlier). However, if
                                the
                                services are not contractually treated as completed until such time that the sign off is
                                given by the recipient, then the date of supply will be delayed until the earlier of:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The time the retention payment has been made; </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The work has been signed off as complete; or</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The tax invoice has been issued.</p>
                                </li>


                            </ul>


                            <p>This means that where the construction services are not considered to be contractually
                                complete, VAT is only due to the extent of any payments received or invoices issued
                                during delivery of the services. Under Article 26, even where the services are
                                contractually complete, there is no tax point until an invoice is issued or payment is
                                received or 12 months has passed – whichever is earlier. The VAT applicable on the
                                retention payment would not be due to be accounted for by the supplier until the time
                                the retention payment is received by the supplier, or an invoice in respect of the
                                retention payment is issued, whichever is earlier. </p>


                            <p>Where retention payments become due for payment to the supplier after 1 January
                                2018 which relate to supplies of services which were completed prior to 1 January
                                2018, the payment received by the supplier should be outside the scope of VAT.
                                Where a retention payment becomes due for payment to the supplier after 1 January
                                2018 and the supply is not considered to be completed until the retention is signed off,
                                then VAT shall be applicable on the value of the retention payment received</p>

                            <h3>Snagging</h3>
                            <p>Snagging generally occurs where the customer is not happy with the standard of work
                                provided by the builder. In many cases the customer will have held a retention payment
                                in respect of the possible snags that may be identified in the course of construction.
                            </p>
                            <p>In most cases the builder will be asked to rectify the snag usually at their cost.
                                Alternatively, the developer may invite a different builder to resolve the snags. </p>
                            <p>Where the original builder corrects the snags at his cost he will not receive any further
                                consideration. Therefore, there is no further supply being made by the builder and the
                                snagging works are considered to be part of the original supply. The builder will not be
                                required to account for VAT on the liability of the works undertaken. </p>

                            <p>Where the customer uses a second supplier to correct the snags, or where the original
                                supplier corrects the snags for an additional fee, there is an additional supply of
                                services to the customer and VAT will be due on that supply. However, in these cases
                                the customer may withhold the retention permanently – and therefore VAT is not due
                                on that element. If VAT has already been accounted for (because a tax invoice was
                                issued or the 12-months rule had applied), then the supplier may consider using the
                                bad debt relief provisions (if he considers the payment is still due) or a credit note
                                (if
                                he accepts the payment is not due at all) to credit VAT overpaid.</p>

                            <h3>Partially completed buildings</h3>
                            <p>A building is normally considered complete on the date the building is certified as being
                                complete by an appropriately qualified party. However, if the building is occupied
                                before this date, the date on which the building is occupied shall be taken to be the
                                date of completion.</p>
                            <p>If you sell a partly completed commercial building prior to its completion, your supply
                                will be standard-rated unless it qualifies to be treated as part of a transfer of a
                                going
                                concern.</p>
                            <p>If a building does not exist at the time of the entry into the contract for sale, the
                                position will depend on the terms of the contract. However, Article 26(1) of the VAT
                                Decree
                                Law provides that the date of supply for any contract that includes periodic payments or
                                consecutive invoices should be the earliest of the date of issuance of tax invoice,
                                the date payment is due or the date of receipt of payment.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, Article 5(2) of the VAT Decree-Law provides that the entry into a contract
                                between two parties which entails the transfer of goods at a later time is also treated
                                as a supply of goods. Article 2(3) of the VAT Executive Regulations states that a
                                contract should be treated as a supply of goods where the agreement stipulates a
                                transfer or intention to transfer the ownership of goods or a future transfer of
                                ownership
                                of goods. Furthermore, depending on the facts, in any situation where there is a
                                combination of a supply of goods and services, any service element is likely to be
                                treated as part of a composite supply in which case the VAT treatment of the predominant
                                supply of goods would apply.</p>
