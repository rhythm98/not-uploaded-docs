                                        associated with VAT and is not intended for legal reference but as a framework
                                        discussing VAT issues relevant specifically to the automotive sector. As a

                                        the guide does not provide an overview of the general operation of VAT but
                                        assumes that
                                        the reader already has an understanding of the basic principles of VAT. For

                    <h3>Sale of Cars within the UAE</h3>
                    <p>The sale of cars
                        within the UAE is subject to VAT at 5%. It is important to note that the sale of cars can be
                        carried out
                        by a number of different types of agreements. In this guide, the two most common types of
                        agreements,
                        i.e. outright sales and sale through hire-purchase arrangements, will be discussed. In addition,
                        the
                        guide will also explain the VAT implications in respect of the leasing of cars.</p>

                            <p>The simplest
                                form of sale of cars within the UAE is by way of an outright sale. This happens when a
                                customer
                                either has cash resources available or has borrowed funds from a financial institution

                                purchase the vehicle outright. The VAT implications of outright sales are as follows:

                            <p>Where a motor
                                vehicle trader sells cars to customers under hire-purchase arrangements, two separate

                                take place for VAT purposes. The first supply is by the motor vehicle trader to the
                                finance
                                company; and the second supply is by the finance company to the customer. For a car sold
                                under
                                such an arrangement, the motor vehicle trader transfers the ownership of the car to the

                                company which lets the hirer use the car during the period of hire. The ownership of the
                                car is
                                passed to the hirer upon full payment of all the hire instalments.</p>

                                <p>As a
                                    supplier making a supply of a car to the finance company, a motor vehicle trader
                                    is
                                    required to issue a tax invoice to the finance company and account for VAT on
                                    the sale
                                    price of the car.</p>

                            </ol>
                            <p>The finance
                                company is in turn required to issue invoices to the customer which will generally have
                                two
                                components: (a) the hire instalments which are subject to VAT; and (b) the interest
                                amounts
                                which are exempt for VAT purposes. However, if the finance charge is included in the
                                total
                                amount payable by the customer in instalments, then the total amount payable will be
                                liable to
                                VAT, as the amount will be subject to the same VAT treatment as the car itself.</p>

                            <p>It is
                                important to note that often a finance company will issue consecutive invoices to the
                                customer
                                under the hire-purchase arrangement, for example monthly invoices for the term of the
                                hire
                                period. In such a case, the date of supply will be determined in accordance with Article
                                26 of
                                the Decree-Law. Accordingly, whilst the finance company would have passed the possession
                                of the
                                car over to the customer at the beginning of the contract, it will not be under an
                                obligation to
                                account for VAT on the full value upfront. In contrast, the finance company will be able
                                to
                                account for VAT as and when it issues invoices (provided payments are not received prior
                                to issuance of the
                                invoices).</p>
                            <p><u>Repossession of cars
                                    sold under hire-purchase arrangements</u></p>

                            <p>Under a
                                typical hire-purchase arrangement, a customer essentially receives a right to use the
                                car from
                                the finance company and at the end of the hire period, the ownership of the car passes
                                from the
                                finance company to the customer.</p>

                            <p>Where a
                                finance company repossesses a car supplied under a hire-purchase arrangement before the
                                expiry
                                of the hire period, the right provided to use the car ceases. It is important to note
                                that no
                                supply takes place for VAT purposes on account of repossession of the car and therefore
                                no VAT
                                implications arise at this point. However, when the finance company further supplies the
                                car to
                                another customer, the normal VAT implications arise.</p>

                            <p>It is possible
                                that a finance company may have issued tax invoice(s) to a customer for a certain period
                                but is
                                not able to collect the debt before repossessing the car. As the finance company would
                                have
                                accounted for VAT at the time of issuing the invoice, it will be entitled to adjust the
                                output
                                tax under the Bad Debt Scheme<span>4 </span>provided the prescribed conditions are
                                met.</p>

                            <h3>Trade-ins</h3>
                            <p>It is a common
                                practice for a customer to trade in an old car for a new car. In a trade- in situation,
                                two
                                separate supplies take place for VAT purposes:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The sale of the new car
                                        to the customer; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The
                                        customer&apos;s sale of the old car to the motor vehicle trader.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>For (a), the
                                motor vehicle trader should account for VAT on the sales price of the new car. In
                                computing the
                                amount of VAT to charge on the sale of the new car, the motor vehicle trader should not
                                net-off
                                the trade-in value of the old car against the sales price of the new car.</p>

                            <p>The position
                                stated above also applies to &rsquo;trade-in over allowances&apos; where a motor vehicle trader
                                agrees to
                                purchase an old car for a value higher than the market value. In such a case also, while
                                accounting for VAT on the new car, the motor vehicle dealer should not net-off the
                                trade-in
                                value (including the over allowance) of the old car.</p>

                            <h3>Price display</h3>
                            <p>Cars are often
                                displayed by motor vehicle traders in their showrooms. For sales of cars to the public,
                                a motor
                                trader vehicle must display, advertise, publish or quote VAT- inclusive prices. This is
                                required
                                so that the customer knows upfront the price that is payable for the car. For example,
                                if the
                                car is priced at AED 100,000 and the VAT applicable on the sale is AED 5,000, a motor
                                vehicle
                                trader must advertise the price as AED 105,000 with a stipulation that the price
                                includes VAT.
                            </p>

                            <p>There are two
                                exceptions to the above rule where the advertised price is not required to be inclusive
                                of VAT:
                                (a) Where the supply of car is for export; and (b) Where the customer is registered for
                                VAT. If
                                any of the exceptions apply and a motor vehicle trader advertises the price as exclusive
                                of VAT,
                                it must clearly specify that the price is exclusive of VAT.</p>

                    <h3>Sale of used/ pre-owned cars</h3>
                    <p>The sale of used cars
                        is also subject to VAT at 5%, provided the sale is made by a VAT registered supplier. The
                        implications
                        relating to the date of supply, invoicing obligations and payment of tax as discussed in section
                        2.1
                        above apply similarly to the sale of used cars. Further, the implications regarding price
                        displays apply
                        similarly to used cars as well &ndash; irrespective of whether the VAT is accounted for on the full
                        sales
                        value of the car or in accordance with the Profit Margin Scheme as discussed below.</p>

                    <p>A key difference
                        between the VAT implications for the sale of new cars and the sale of used cars is the
                        possibility of
                        accounting for VAT using the Profit Margin Scheme which is available to motor vehicle dealers
                        trading in
                        used cars.</p>

                            <h3>Profit Margin Scheme</h3>
                            <p>In accordance
                                with the Profit Margin Scheme<span>6</span>, a VAT registered supplier can account
                                for VAT on the basis of the profit earned on taxable supplies instead of accounting for
                                VAT on
                                the value of such supplies. In other words, under the Profit Margin Scheme, VAT can be
                                accounted
                                for on the difference between what was paid for a good at the time of purchasing it and
                                what was
                                charged to the customer at the time of selling it.</p>

                            <p>Amongst other
                                things, the Profit Margin Scheme can also be used to account for VAT when selling used
                                cars. It
                                is important to note that applying the Profit Margin Scheme is optional. The rationale
                                for the
                                Profit Margin Scheme and the conditions which must be met for applying the scheme are
                                discussed

                                    <h3>Rationale for the Profit Margin Scheme</h3>
                                    <p>The
                                        Profit Margin Scheme is intended to avoid the cascading of taxes. The cascading
                                        effect
                                        arises where a motor vehicle trader purchases a used car from a non-registered
                                        seller or
                                        from a seller who also accounted for VAT by reference to the Profit Margin
                                        Scheme and
                                        consequently the motor vehicle trader is not able to recover the VAT embedded in
                                        the
                                        price of the car. The Profit Margin Scheme seeks to avoid this cascading issue
                                        by
                                        permitting the motor vehicle trader to account for VAT only on the profit earned
                                        on the
                                        supply.</p>

                            <h3>Instances when the Profit Margin Scheme does not apply</h3>
                            <p>As stated in the
                                preceding paragraphs, the Profit Margin Scheme applies only when the prescribed
                                conditions
                                are fully
                                satisfied. Below are two instances where the scheme does not apply &ndash; however, certain
                                businesses
                                have incorrectly applied the scheme in these instances:</p>

                            <ol type='a'>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Cars purchased prior to the
                                        implementation of VAT</p>

                                    <p>One of the
                                        conditions for the application of the Profit Margin Scheme is that the goods
                                        should have
                                        been previously subject to VAT before the supply in question. Accordingly, any
                                        stock on hand
                                        of used goods which were acquired prior to the implementation of VAT, or which
                                        have not
                                        previously been subject to VAT for other reasons, are not eligible to be sold
                                        under the
                                        Profit Margin Scheme.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Cars
                                        imported into the UAE where the VAT paid upon import has been recovered</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>In accordance with
                                Article 29 of the Executive Regulation, the Profit Margin Scheme applies to instances
                                where goods
                                are purchased from: (i) a person who is not a VAT registrant or, (ii) a taxable person
                                who
                                calculated the tax on the supply by reference to the profit margin. The scheme is also
                                applicable
                                where goods are purchased from a VAT registered supplier but input tax is not recovered
                                by reference
                                to Article 53 of the Executive Regulation</p>

                            <p>While the overseas
                                supplier is <b>not </b>a VAT registrant in the UAE and consequently does not charge VAT
                                on the sale,
                                the scheme generally does not apply to scenarios where the purchase is made through
                                import. This is
                                because at the time of import, the importer would be able to recover the input tax.
                                Accordingly, the
                                sale of imported &rsquo;used&apos; cars into the UAE is not eligible for the Profit Margin Scheme.
                                However, if
                                the import VAT was not recovered by the importer by reference to Article 53 of the
                                Executive
                                Regulation, the Profit Margin Scheme will continue to remain applicable.</p>

                        basis) or shorter durations (i.e. on a daily or weekly basis). The activity of leasing cars is a
                        taxable
                        supply which is subject to VAT at 5%.</p>

                            <h3>VAT implications on lease of cars</h3>
                            <p>The
                                implications relating to the date of supply, invoicing obligations and payment of tax as
                                discussed in section 2.1 above apply similarly to the lease of cars. Where the contract
                                for the
                                lease of cars is for an extended period, it is expected that the contract will involve
                                periodic
                                payments or consecutive invoices, and therefore the date of supply will be the earliest
                                of any
                                of the following dates provided that it does not exceed one year from the start of the
                                lease:

                            <h3>Value of supply in the case of lease of cars</h3>
                            <p>The usual
                                rules to determine the value of supply<span>8 </span>also apply to the leasing of
                                cars. Therefore, where the entire consideration is monetary, the value of supply is the
                                consideration less the tax amount. In other words, the value of supply is the entire
                                amount
                                received or expected to be received for the lease of cars, less the tax amount.</p>


                            <p>It is observed
                                that certain suppliers do not consider that they should account for VAT on the entire
                                sum that
                                they receive for the leasing of cars to VAT. It is, however, the supplier&apos;s obligation
                                to
                                carefully consider the different components of fees charged by them and account for VAT
                                accordingly.</p>

                            <div class='example'>
                                <p>
                                    Example</p>

                                <p>A motor vehicle
                                    trader, XYZ LLC, leased a car to a tourist for three months. The customer regularly
                                    used one
                                    of the toll roads which resulted in salik being deducted from the vehicle&apos;s account.
                                    The
                                    lease contract stipulated that the cost of salik will be recharged by XYZ LLC to the
                                    customer.</p>

                                <p>The salik
                                    deducted from the account is essentially a cost incurred by XYZ LLC to provide car
                                    leasing
                                    services to the customer. The recharge of such a cost is subject to VAT and should
                                    be
                                    included in the taxable value of the supply.</p>

                                noted that one of the common conditions for zero-rating of exports is that the supplier

                                case of a direct export) or the recipient (in the case of an indirect export) must

                                official and commercial evidence of export.</p>

                                evidence means export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department in

                                car leaving the UAE &ndash; this would require the exporter to retain a certificate issued by
                                the
                                relevant Customs Department proving the exit of the car from the UAE (for example, an

                                provides
                                evidence of the transportation of the car to outside the UAE. Acceptable commercial

                                includes airway bills, bills of lading, consignment notes, and certificates of

                            <p>The purpose

                                the UAE.
                                As such, the official and commercial evidence of export must identify the following:</p>

                                <p>ABC LLC is
                                    a motor vehicle trader established in Abu Dhabi. On a visit to the UAE for tourism
                                    purposes,
                                    Mr. X decides to purchase a car from ABC LLC. Mr. X has represented that he will
                                    self-drive
                                    the car to Oman and whilst he will be able to submit official evidence of export
                                    (i.e. exit
                                    certificate), he will not be able to furnish any commercial evidence of export
                                    because no
                                    logistics company will be appointed for transporting the car.</p>

                                <p>ABC LLC should
                                    submit a request for an administrative exception requesting the FTA to allow the use
                                    of an
                                    alternative form of evidence (instead of commercial evidence) so that the company is

                            <h3>Multiple sale of cars resulting in single export</h3>
                            <p>It is common in
                                the automotive sector that a single export is supported by two or more underlying sales
                                of cars. In
                                such instances where a single export is supported by two or more underlying supplies,
                                only the final
                                supply can be zero-rated.</p>

                            <p>For example:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A Customer
                                        based in the USA orders a car from a motor vehicle trader &ldquo;X&rdquo; (based in the
                                        UAE);</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>&ldquo;X&rdquo;
                                        purchases the car from another motor vehicle trader &ldquo;Y&rdquo; (also based in the UAE)
                                        but does not
                                        take delivery of the car;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Y&rdquo;, at the request of &ldquo;X&rdquo;,
                                        exports the car directly to the customer in USA.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the
                                above example, there are two separate underlying transactions but one export of car and
                                accordingly the VAT treatment will be:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The
                                        supply of the car from Y to X is a local supply in the UAE and VAT at the rate
                                        of 5% must be
                                        accounted for on this supply;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The
                                        supply of the car from X to the customer in the USA is zero-rated as an export
                                        subject to
                                        the satisfaction of the relevant conditions. It is important to note that in
                                        this example, Y
                                        is acting as an agent to export the car on behalf of X and, therefore, the
                                        export documents
                                        must demonstrate this fact clearly, for example, in the remarks section of the
                                        customs
                                        declaration.</p>

                            <p>Where cars are
                                imported into the UAE from abroad, the cars will be subject to import VAT at 5%. Import
                                VAT is
                                imposed on the customs value as calculated pursuant to Customs legislation, including
                                the value
                                of insurance, freight and any customs fees paid on the import of the cars. Where the
                                determination of such customs value is not possible, then the value can be determined
                                based on
                                the alternative valuation rules stated in the applicable Customs legislation.</p>

                            <p>The obligation
                                to account for import VAT is on the &ldquo;importer&rdquo;, being the person whose name is listed as

                                importer of the relevant cars for customs clearance purposes. The mechanism for
                                accounting for
                                VAT on imported cars depends on the VAT registration status of the importer at the time
                                of
                                importation.</p>

                            <p>In certain
                                situations, an importer may be able to account for VAT in the VAT return which relates
                                to the
                                tax period in which the cars are imported. In order for this to occur, the importer must
                                meet
                                the following conditions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the importer must be
                                        registered for VAT at the time of import;</p>
                                </li>

                                        the importer must have sufficient details for the FTA to verify the import and

                                        which is due on the import and is able to provide these as required;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                        importer must have provided the FTA via the eServices portal with its own

                                        registration number issued by the competent Customs department for the import in
                                        question; and</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>the
                                        importer must cooperate with, and comply with any rules imposed by the FTA in
                                        respect of
                                        the import.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In practice,
                                these conditions require a VAT-registered importer to register its Customs registration
                                number
                                with the FTA prior to importing cars into the UAE (this can be done at the time of
                                registering
                                for VAT or at a later time). When any cars are subsequently imported into the UAE by
                                this
                                importer using the Customs registration number which is registered with the FTA, no VAT
                                will be
                                charged at the time of import and the cars will be released to the importer as soon as
                                other
                                customs formalities are completed. The applicable import VAT would then be prepopulated
                                as
                                output tax in box 6 of the importer&apos;s next VAT return. It should be noted that the
                                importer has
                                an ongoing obligation to ensure that the VAT return reflects the correct VAT payable in
                                respect
                                of the import &ndash; as a consequence, the importer should review the correctness of the
                                import VAT prepopulated in its VAT return and make corrections in box 7 of the VAT
                                return, if
                                necessary.</p>

                            <p>VAT incurred

                            <h3>Import with the assistance of an import clearing agent</h3>
                            <p>Often, the
                                task of importing goods (including cars) into the UAE and fulfilling all importation
                                formalities
                                is delegated to a clearing agent. For example, the task of clearing the goods through
                                Customs
                                may be undertaken by a specialised clearing agent, a freight forwarder responsible for
                                delivering the goods to the purchaser, or a third-party local company.</p>

                            <p>Where a
                                clearing agent or equivalent business is importing goods on behalf of a VAT- registered
                                importer, the clearing agent should declare the importer&apos;s TRN on the customs import
                                declaration. This will allow the importer to account for the import VAT in its VAT
                                return as
                                described in section 6.2.</p>

                            <p>On the other
                                hand, where a clearing agent is importing goods on behalf of a non- registered importer,
                                the
                                agent should declare its C/O TRN on the customs import declaration and should be
                                responsible for
                                the payment of VAT in respect of the import in its VAT return.</p>

                            <p>It should be
                                noted that since the clearing agent or equivalent business is not the owner of the
                                goods, but
                                simply facilitates the import of those goods into the UAE, it should <b>not </b>recover
                                the
                                import VAT as its own input tax in the VAT return, and doing so would expose the
                                clearing agent
                                or equivalent business to an assessment for over-recovered VAT and penalties. Instead,
                                if the VAT is paid by the clearing agent or equivalent business, the
                                amount can be recharged by the agent directly to the importer. To do so, the clearing
                                agent or
                                equivalent business must issue a statement to the importer which contains, as a minimum,
                                the
                                following details:</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>the
                                        amount of VAT paid by the agent to the FTA in respect of the imported goods.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It should be
                                noted that the statement issued by the clearing agent is treated as a <em>de facto</em>
                                tax
                                invoice for VAT purposes. As a consequence, the importer is able to rely on the
                                statement to
                                recover VAT if and when available (for example, if the non-registered importer registers
                                for VAT
                                at a later date and it was eligible to recover the input tax paid before registration on
                                such
                                goods imported).</p>

                                requires all clearing agents to retain copies of these statements, so that they are
                                available
                                for inspection when the FTA undertakes audits of these agents&apos; VAT accounts.</p>

                        a guarantee given by a manufacturer to his customer, undertaking to remedy any defects of the
                        car due to
                        faulty workmanship or materials for a specified period.</p>

                    <p>Generally, a warranty
                        service is made available to the customer at the time of sale of the car and in such instances
                        the price
                        for the warranty service is included in the price of the car. In other cases, the warranty
                        service is
                        supplied separately from the sale of the car and in such instances the price for the warranty
                        service is
                        charged separately.</p>

                            <h3>Warranty service included in the price of car</h3>
                            <p>As stated in
                                the preceding paragraph, in cases where the cost of the warranty is included in the
                                price of the
                                car, the supplier would undertake to repair any defects in the car for a specified
                                period free
                                of charge. In other words, the supplier would not charge any extra fees for the warranty
                                repair
                                services provided during the specified period.</p>

                            <p>As VAT would
                                have already been accounted for on the original supply of the car (including on the
                                price for
                                the warranty), no further VAT implications will arise at the time of providing the
                                actual repair
                                services. It should be noted that the input tax incurred on carrying out the warranty
                                repair
                                services will be recoverable since it was incurred in the making of taxable supplies.
                                This
                                position will also apply to the sale of used cars where a motor vehicle dealer has
                                accounted for
                                VAT under the Profit Margin Scheme (provided the cost of warranty is included in the
                                price of
                                the used car).</p>

                            <h3>Warranty service supplied for an extra charge</h3>
                            <p>A supplier may
                                provide its customers with the option to purchase an extended warranty for a specified
                                period.
                                The extended warranty is provided for a separate charge and the supplier undertakes to
                                rectify
                                any defect in the car during the additional period and does not charge any further
                                amount to
                                carry out actual repair services.</p>

                            <p>The supply of
                                an extended warranty is a taxable supply of services which is subject to VAT at 5%. The
                                supplier
                                accordingly needs to account for VAT on the supply of the extended warranty. The actual
                                repair
                                services provided during the additional period would, however, not attract VAT. This is
                                because
                                the VAT would have already been accounted for on the supply of extended warranty and no
                                further
                                implications arise at the time of providing actual repair services.</p>

                            <h3>Reimbursement of repair costs by distributors from manufacturers</h3>
                            <p>Where a
                                distributor provides warranty services to a customer in the UAE, no VAT implications
                                arise. This
                                is because a distributor&apos;s warranty for no extra charge is treated as a composite supply
                                together with the vehicle sold on which VAT has already been accounted for at the time
                                of the
                                original sale.</p>

                            <p>It should be
                                noted that warranties are typically provided by the car manufacturers. Where a
                                distributor is
                                involved in the supply chain, the manufacturer&apos;s warranty is essentially passed on to
                                the end
                                customer. Such arrangements, therefore, allow the distributor to recover the costs
                                incurred in
                                honoring the warranty on behalf of the manufacturer.</p>

                            <p>The supply
                                made by the distributor under a warranty arrangement with the manufacturer is a separate
                                supply
                                for VAT purposes. Accordingly, the VAT treatment relating to the recovery of costs
                                relating to
                                such supplies needs to be determined independently.</p>

                            <p>For vehicles
                                manufactured outside the UAE, a key point to note is that the reimbursement of costs by
                                UAE
                                distributors from overseas manufacturers to carry out warranty repairs is subject to VAT
                                at 5%.
                                This is because the pre-requisite<span>11 </span>for treating the supply as a
                                zero-rated export of service (i.e. the service must not be supplied directly in
                                connection goods
                                situated in the UAE) is not met.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Example</p>

                                <p>A Germany based
                                    manufacturer of cars, XYZ Gmbh, sells cars in the UAE through its exclusive
                                    distributor ABC
                                    LLC. Mohammad purchased a car from ABC LLC and the sales price included a 5-year
                                    warranty.
                                    On noticing some issue in the engine of the car, Mohammad took the car for a
                                    service. ABC
                                    LLC confirmed that certain parts in the engine need repair and that the service will
                                    be
                                    covered under the warranty.</p>

                                <p>Whilst ABC LLC
                                    did not charge any fees to Mohammad for repairing the engine, it recovered the cost
                                    from XYZ
                                    Gmbh. The supply made by ABC LLC to XYZ Gmbh to carry out warranty repairs is
                                    subject to VAT
                                    at 5%. The supply will not qualify for zero-rating because the services are provided
                                    directly in connection with goods (i.e. the car) situated in the UAE.</p>

                    <h3>Auctions</h3>
                    <p>Motor vehicle traders
                        may make sales of cars at auctions. Auctions are places where goods are sold to the highest
                        bidder.
                        Although the motor vehicle trader (hereafter referred to as an &ldquo;auctioneer&rdquo;) could be the owner
                        /
                        principal seller of the cars, auctions are more commonly conducted by the auctioneer acting as
                        an agent
                        on behalf of other persons selling their cars.</p>

                    <p>The VAT treatment of
                        auctions depends on whether the auctioneer is acting as a principal supplier or as an agent on
                        behalf of
                        another person.</p>

                            <h3>Auctioneer acting as the principal supplier</h3>
                            <p>In these
                                instances, the auctioneer is, for VAT purposes, the principal supplier of the cars. This
                                arrangement is also known as &ldquo;undisclosed agency&rdquo; where two supplies take place for VAT
                                purposes
                                i.e. (i) between the seller and the auctioneer; and (ii) between the auctioneer and the
                                end
                                customer.</p>

                            <p>As a
                                consequence, similar to any other person making a supply of goods, the auctioneer has to
                                consider whether or not it should charge VAT on the sale. Where the auctioneer is
                                registered for
                                VAT, the auctioneer must account for VAT at 5% on the supply (unless the conditions of
                                zero
                                rating are met on exporting the cars). Further, where the auctioneer is not registered
                                for VAT,
                                it must evaluate whether VAT registration obligations have arisen on account of the
                                supply.</p>

                            <h3>Auctioneer acting as an agent of the principal supplier</h3>
                            <p>The second
                                type of arrangement, which is more common, is when the auctioneer is not the owner /
                                supplier of
                                cars, but simply provides the marketplace and assistance in the process of selling the
                                cars
                                belonging to others through the auction. This arrangement is also known as &ldquo;disclosed
                                agency&rdquo;.
                            </p>

                            <p>In such
                                situations, the auctioneer is not a principal supplier of the cars in question. Instead,
                                the
                                auctioneer is acting as an agent on behalf of and in the name of the owner of the cars
                                as per
                                Article 9(1) of the Decree-Law. As a consequence, when the cars are sold, the sale
                                constitutes,
                                for VAT purposes, a supply by the principal seller directly to the principal buyer &ndash;
                                with the
                                auctioneer being ignored for the purposes of the sale.</p>

                            <p>This means
                                that the VAT treatment of the sale of the cars must be considered from the perspective
                                of the
                                principal supplier / owner of the cars. As such, depending on the facts of the sale, the
                                supply
                                may be either standard-rated (if the principal supplier is registered for VAT),
                                zero-rated (if the principal supplier is registered for VAT and the car
                                is exported from the UAE) or outside the scope of VAT (if the principal supplier is not
                                registered and not required to register for VAT).</p>

                            <p>It should be
                                noted that in situations where the auctioneer makes a sale of car as an agent on behalf
                                of a
                                principal seller, it is the obligation of the principal seller, rather than the
                                auctioneer, to
                                correctly comply with their tax obligations in respect of the sale. It is common for
                                auctions
                                that payments for the sold cars are made by the buyer to the principal supplier through
                                the
                                auctioneer. Where this is the case, the auctioneer would be expected to pass on the VAT
                                charged
                                by the principal supplier to that supplier, in order to enable the supplier to account
                                for this
                                VAT to the FTA.</p>

                            <p>The FTA
                                expects the auctioneer to maintain sufficient documents to establish that the sale was
                                made
                                directly by the principal supplier to the customer and the auctioneer only acted as an
                                intermediary. Such documents could include: a contract (if any) between the principal
                                seller and
                                the auctioneer; a copy of an invoice issued by the principal seller to the customer; the
                                invoice

                            <h3>Issuance of tax invoices by auctioneer on behalf of the principal supplier</h3>
                            <p>In accordance
                                with Article 65 of the Decree-Law, where a taxable supply is made by a VAT-registered
                                person,
                                the taxable person must issue and deliver a valid tax invoice to the recipient of the
                                goods or
                                services. This requirement applies without exception for any supplies subject to VAT at
                                5%.
                                Therefore, in the event that a taxable supply is made at an auction, it is a requirement
                                that a
                                tax invoice is both issued and delivered to the buyer of the car.</p>

                            <p>Typically, the
                                tax invoice must be issued by the VAT-registered supplier of the car itself, in
                                accordance with
                                the requirements in Article 59 of the Executive Regulation. However, pursuant to Article
                                59(11)
                                of the Executive Regulation, a VAT-registered agent which makes a supply on behalf of a
                                VAT-registered principal supplier may issue their own tax invoice in respect of the
                                supply with
                                the particulars of the agent, as if that agent had made the supply of goods or services
                                itself
                                (the invoice should, however, contain a reference to the principal supplier, including
                                the
                                supplier&apos;s name and TRN on the invoice). If the agent does issue a tax invoice on behalf
                                of the
                                principal supplier under this provision, the principal supplier should not issue any
                                other tax
                                invoice in respect of the same supply. Furthermore, the principal supplier remains
                                responsible
                                for accounting for the VAT on the supply to the FTA and still must comply with all other
                                tax
                                obligations in respect of the supply.</p>
                            <p>
                                The rule discussed in the preceding paragraphs may also be used by auctioneers in order
                                to issue
                                their own tax invoices to buyers of cars sold at an auction.</p>

                            <p>It is common
                                that the auctioneer will charge a commission and/or premium to the principal supplier of
                                a car
                                or the buyer of a car or both. Such commission and/or premium is consideration for a
                                taxable
                                supply by the auctioneer of auctioning services. Where the auctioneer is registered, or
                                required
                                to be registered, for VAT, the auctioneer must charge VAT on such fees and account for
                                the VAT
                                to the FTA on its tax returns.</p>

                                    the principal supplier and the second car was sold as an agent of a VAT registered

                                traders often offer promotional gifts with the sale of cars free of charge. This means
                                that the
                                motor vehicle trader does not receive any consideration for the supply of free gifts.
                            </p>

                            <p>Where the
                                motor vehicle trader recovers input tax on the purchase of the gift and in turn supplies

                                gift free of charge, the free supply will be subject to the deemed supply
                                <span>12</span>provisions. However, if the motor vehicle trader does not recover input
                                tax on the purchase of the gift, the deemed supply provisions will not
                                <span>13</span>apply.

                            <h3>Discounts</h3>
                            <p>In addition to
                                offering free gifts, motor vehicle traders also operate promotional schemes whereby they
                                offer
                                discounts on the sales price of the cars.</p>

                            <p>Where a motor
                                vehicle trader funds the discount and the customers benefit from the reduction in price,
                                VAT is
                                applicable on the discounted value<span>14 </span>charged by the motor vehicle
                                trader. It is important to note that the tax invoice issued by the motor vehicle trader
                                must
                                clearly state the discount offered to the customer in order to account for VAT on the
                                discounted
                                value.</p>

                            <p>Further, a
                                motor vehicle dealer may itself receive a volume discount / bulk discount from the
                                original
                                manufacturer on purchasing a specified number of units. Where a volume discount is
                                provided by
                                the original manufacturer (for example, a discount on purchasing 100 units of a car),
                                the
                                manufacturer should clearly state the discount on the invoice.</p>

                            <p>In addition, a
                                motor vehicle dealer may also receive a contingent discount or payment from the original
                                manufacturer such as a discount on achieving a sales target or a payment upon selling a
                                specified number of units of a particular car model. In the case of a contingent
                                discount or
                                payment, the parties should carefully evaluate whether the discount/payment in reality
                                reduces
                                the original value of the car or it is in fact consideration for a separate supply made
                                by the
                                motor vehicle dealer. Where the discount/payment actually reduces the original value of
                                the car,
                                the manufacturer should issue a credit note to reduce the value. Alternatively, if the
                                discount/payment is received because the motor vehicle dealer has performed a specific
                                activity, the motor
                                vehicle dealer should issue a tax invoice and charge VAT at the appropriate rate
                                depending on
                                the nature of the supply.</p>

                            <h3>Input tax recovery on the purchase, rent or lease of a company car</h3>
                            <p>The input tax
                                incurred on the purchase, rent or lease of a company car is blocked<span>15 </span>if
                                the car is available for the personal use of an employee.</p>

                            <p>Please note
                                that the fact that a car is taken home by an employee will not of itself preclude a
                                taxable
                                person from recovering input tax provided the reason for this is to ensure that the
                                vehicle is
                                available for emergency purposes, or the nature of the job (and vehicle) is such that it
                                requires the employee to keep the vehicle with himself/herself. The key point, however,
                                is
                                whether the vehicle will be available for personal purposes as well. Where the vehicle
                                is
                                available for personal purposes, the input tax incurred on the purchase, rent or lease
                                of the
                                vehicle is blocked in full.</p>

                            <p>It is
                                important to note that where the input tax on the purchase, rent or lease of a company
                                car is
                                blocked, a taxable person should not recover input tax incurred on associated expenses
                                such as
                                insurance, maintenance, servicing etc.</p>

                            <h3>Demo cars</h3>
                            <p>Motor vehicle traders often
                                display demo cars in their showrooms for demonstration/ test drive purposes. As a demo
                                car cannot be sold at the
                                full retail value, the manufacturer may agree to make a one-off payment in respect of
                                each demo car to
                                compensate the trader for the lower retail value.</p>

                            <p>Where the payment made by the
                                original manufacturer is a genuine reduction of the original sales price, such a payment
                                will be considered as a
                                retrospective discount. In such a case, the original manufacturer should issue a credit
                                note to reduce the
                                original sales price.</p>

                            <p>In contrast, if the payment
                                relates to any obligations assumed by the motor vehicle trader to perform a specific
                                activity (such as marketing
                                services), the payment will be treated as consideration for a taxable supply and the
                                motor vehicle trader will
                                be required to issue a tax invoice and charge VAT at the appropriate rate depending on
                                the nature of the supply.
