                                    <p>VAT was introduced with effect from 1 January 2018 in the UAE. As a general
                                        consumption tax on
                                        the supply of goods and services, its effects must be understood by providers of
                                        financial services
                                        in the UAE, in two contexts:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Its application to the activities of all financial services providers.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>The approach financial services providers in the UAE should take to
                                                determine
                                                the amount of
                                                VAT on costs (i.e. input tax) they are eligible to reclaim where they

                                                both
                                                taxable and
                                                exempt financial services.</p>

                                        to understand
                                        which of
                                        the services and functions it provides are liable to and exempt from VAT and in
                                        turn, the extent

                                    <h3>What are financial services?</h3>
                                    <p>These are services which are provided by businesses or persons which in some way
                                        are
                                        connected with finance. Many such services will be directly related to money.
                                        This could
                                        mean dealings in money or its equivalent, or the provision of credit. It also
                                        includes more
                                        specialist types of finance (for example, hire-purchase or instalment credit
                                        finance) or
                                        more long-term finance, such as shares or loan stock.</p>
                                    <p>Some financial services may not have this direct link with money (for example,
                                        equipment
                                        leasing). In addition, there is a wide range of associated services which have a
                                        less
                                        immediate link to money (for example, financial advice, trustee services and
                                        debt
                                        collection).</p>
                                    <p>Other more peripheral activities include investment brokerage and the
                                        underwriting of
                                        securities.</p>
                                    <p>Financial services typically comprise a complex series of transactions and the
                                        products
                                        offered by the sector are continually evolving, through innovation and
                                        technology. In
                                        addition, the means of remuneration for financial services can also be complex
                                        (for
                                        example, margin and spread).</p>
                                    <p>Historically, transactions in the sector were complex to analyse and presented
                                        difficulties,
                                        both in identifying the supply chains and the values of the various supplies
                                        being made.</p>
                                    <p>However, more recently, financial services have become more easily identifiable
                                        and
                                        measurable than in the past due to technological advancements and global
                                        developments
                                        in the manner in which transactions are conducted.</p>
                                    <p>Accordingly, the starting point for the UAE VAT treatment of financial services
                                        is that VAT
                                        should be charged on financial services where it is practicable to do so.</p>
                                    <p>Specifically, where fees or similar readily identifiable charges are made for the
                                        provision
                                        of a financial service as defined in the Federal Decree-Law1 and Executive
                                        Regulations2,
                                        such fees will be liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>

                            <p>Most business transactions involve supplies of goods or services.</p>
                            <p>A taxable supply is one where there is:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                            <p>Taxable supplies may either be subject to the standard rate or zero rate of VAT.</p>
                            <p>The term ‘taxable supply’ excludes exempt supplies and any supplies that are outside the
                                scope of UAE VAT.</p>

                                    <p>In general terms, where VAT is charged at the standard rate, businesses that are
                                        registered for VAT are able to recover the VAT they are charged by their
                                        suppliers on
                                        goods and services, subject to certain conditions. VAT which is incurred on
                                        purchases is
                                        known as ‘input tax’.</p>

                                        taxable supplies in all respects, including the right of the person making the

                            <h3>What is an exempt supply?</h3>
                            <p>No VAT is charged on exempt supplies. As these supplies are not ‘taxable supplies’, the
                                supplier cannot recover any of the VAT on expenses (input tax) directly incurred in
                                making
                                exempt supplies.</p>
                            <p>In addition, businesses which make supplies with a mixture of differing VAT liabilities
                                will
                                need to use a method of apportionment in respect of VAT incurred on general costs (i.e.
                                input tax which is non-attributable to either taxable or exempt supplies).</p>
                            <p>Incurred VAT therefore may represent a large irrecoverable cost to businesses involved
                                in making supplies which are wholly or partly exempt from VAT, such as those operating
                                in the financial services sector.</p>
                            <p>As codified in the UAE Law and in conformity with its obligations under the GCC VAT
                                Agreement, the UAE has taken a very narrow approach to the use of VAT exemption.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the UAE will tax the majority of transactions taking place in the country at the
                                standard rate, whilst only a very limited number of exceptions to this general rule will
                                be
                                made. These exceptions will include some financial services, subject to certain
                                conditions,
                                as outlined below.</p>

                            <h3>Multiple supplies versus single composite supplies</h3>
                            <p>A business will make multiple supplies where it charges a single inclusive price for a
                                number of separate supplies of goods or services. This is different from a single supply
                                of a mixture of goods or services (known as a single composite supply) to which a single
                                rate of tax applies.</p>
                            <p>These scenarios can apply to financial services which may be packaged or ‘bundled’
                                together where they would ordinarily be treated as separate services or in the opposite
                                situation, where a single composite supply may be unbundled or artificially split into
                                separate components.</p>

                                        method of valuing each supply which is fair and reasonable. This could include
                                        using the
                                        cost of each element of the supply as a proxy for assigning a value to each
                                        component
                                        of the supply. The value of each supply must be disclosed to the customer.</p>

                                <p>For example, a finance company provides credit finance upon the sale of goods via
                                    instalment payments. It charges for the cost of the goods and makes a separately
                                    disclosed interest charge. The interest charge will be exempt and the sale of the
                                    goods
                                    subject to VAT. This is because the two amounts are separately identified and the
                                    products, namely the goods and the supply of credit are not interrelated. </p>

                                    <h3>Single composite supplies</h3>
                                    <p>Single composite supplies are one, single indivisible supply of a mixture of
                                        goods and/or
                                        services. The supply is treated as a single supply and is subject to VAT at one
                                        rate which
                                        is applied to the value of the supply as a whole. You must not use apportionment
                                        where
                                        you make a composite supply.</p>
                                    <p>There will be a single composite supply where one or more elements of the supply
                                        comprise the principal component, with other elements being ancillary – i.e. not
                                        an aim in
                                        itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal component. The contractual
                                        nature and
                                        wider circumstances of such supplies will be taken into account.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, there will be a single composite supply where there is a supply
                                        which has two
                                        or more elements which are so closely linked that they form a single supply and
                                        which it
                                        would be artificial or impossible to split.</p>
                                    <p>Charging a single price is not determinative, but may suggest that there is a
                                        single service.
                                        However, where there are indications that the recipient intended to buy two
                                        distinct
                                        services, with different VAT liabilities, this could mean that the single price
                                        should be
                                        apportioned.</p>
                                    <p>Single composite supplies will not be accepted as such, unless:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                                be affected were the recipient only to purchase the principal component
                                                of the
                                                supply; and</p>

                                            <p>All the components of the supply are supplied by a single supplier.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>For example, as a promotional offer, a bank may offer a loan product at a
                                        particular rate
                                        of interest which includes giving a new tablet to customers in order to make the

                                        more attractive. Any fees or prices are not separately identified. The tablet is

                                        Shariah
                                        compliant, and which has the intention of and achieves effectively the same
                                        result as a
                                        non-Islamic financial product, shall be treated in such a way as to give an
                                        outcome for the
                                        purposes of the Law comparable to that which would be the case for its
                                        non-Islamic
                                        counterpart.</p>
                                    <p>This is to ensure equality of VAT treatment between Islamic and non-Islamic
                                        finance
                                        products. </p>
                                        <p>In determining the correct VAT treatment for Islamic finance products,
                                            the purpose,
                                            structure and pricing of the Islamic product will be considered.</p>
                                    <p>Accordingly, in order to ascertain the VAT liability of an Islamic financial
                                        product, the
                                        following process should be followed.</p>

                                        <h3>Example</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Apply the same VAT treatment to the Islamic Finance supplies.</p>
                                    <p>For example, a commodity Murabaha entered into for lending purposes will be treated as 
                                        a loan for VAT purposes. Any explicit fees will be taxable, unless the fees are only made 
                                        explicit as a requirement of Shariah law and where their non-Islamic equivalents would 
                                        also be treated as exempt.</p>
                                    <p>Accordingly, the profit derived from the supply of the commodity on deferred payment 
                                        terms would be exempt if this is used de facto as a loan and the non-Islamic equivalent 
                                        consideration is interest.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <h3>Non-equivalent Products</h3>
                                    <p>It is recognised, however, that certain aspects of Islamic finance may preclude direct 
                                        equivalence in VAT treatment being applied. In such cases, the underlying purpose, features 
                                        and circumstances of the product concerned must be taken into account when 
                                        determining the appropriate VAT treatment.</p>
                                    <p>Any significant difference in the overall liability between an Islamic financial product and 
                                        any non-Islamic counterpart arising as a consequence of differential treatment being 
                                        applied will be addressed on a product-by-product basis.</p>
                                    <p>Providers of particularly complex or non-standard Islamic financial products should 
                                        analyse these carefully and consider seeking advice on the VAT liability of such products.</p>

                                        attributable to
                                        different supplies, each of which carries a different right to recovery, there
                                        is an inherent
                                        risk that the means by which that apportionment is carried out and the results
                                        it renders
                                        are not necessarily representative of actual use.</p>
                                    <p>In that regard, all businesses must take care when making use of an input tax
                                        apportionment method that it is ‘fair and reasonable’ in their particular
                                        circumstances.
                                        Where it is not, the business should take steps to ensure that an approved
                                        alternative
                                        method is identified and adopted. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) will closely
                                        examine
                                        the results of input tax apportionment methods used by businesses as part of its
