                            <p>In traditional commerce, goods and services are usually supplied from a physical
                                location, such
                                as a shop or office, with the supplier and the recipient usually present in the same

                            <p>E-commerce (also known as "electronic commerce" or sometimes loosely referred to as the

                                electronic network, with goods and services being sourced or supplied by electronic

                                There are, however, a number of additional VAT rules which are intended to apply

                            <p>UAE VAT is governed by the Decree-Law and the Executive Regulation.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that VAT legislation contemplates special rules for cross-border

                                goods and services between the UAE and "Implementing States", which are the GCC States
                                that are
                                implementing a VAT system. At the current time, none of the GCC states are considered to
                                be
                                Implementing States for the purposes of the UAE VAT. As a consequence, this version of

                                does not cover special rules applicable to supplies with Implementing States.</p>

                            <h3>2.3. What is VAT?</h3>
                            <p>VAT is a transaction-based indirect tax, which is charged and collected at each stage of
                                the
                                supply chain by legal and natural persons ("persons") which meet the requirements to be
                                registered for VAT.</p>
                            <p>Thus, persons which are either registered or are required to register for VAT (known as
                                "taxable
                                persons") charge VAT to their customers on taxable supplies of goods or services. A
                                taxable
                                supply is defined in the VAT legislation as a "supply of goods or services for a
                                consideration
                                by a person conducting business in the UAE, and does not include an exempt
                                supply".<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> As a consequence, for a supply
                                to be a
                                taxable supply, the following conditions must be met:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>there needs to be a supply of goods or services;</li>
                                <li>the supply has to be for consideration;</li>
                                <li>the supply has to be made by a person who is conducting business in the UAE; and
                                </li>
                                <li>the supply should not be an exempt supply.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Taxable supplies may either be subject to the standard rate of 5%<sup><a
                                        href="#footnote2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup> or zero rate<sup><a href="#footnote3"
                                        id="ref3">[3]</a></sup> (i.e. 0%). A supply cannot be a taxable supply if it is
                                an exempt supply. Where a supply is neither a taxable supply nor an exempt supply, it
                                will be outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p>
                            <p>VAT which taxable persons charge to their customers is known as "output tax". On a
                                periodic
                                basis, taxable persons are required to account for output tax to the FTA. This is done
                                by
                                submitting a periodic tax return (also known as a "VAT return").</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that taxable persons will typically be charged VAT (known as "input
                                tax") by
                                their suppliers when they acquire goods and services. Taxable persons are generally able
                                to
                                recover input tax, subject to certain conditions. Where the conditions allowing recovery
                                of
                                input tax are met, taxable persons are able to deduct this input tax from the value of
                                output
                                tax declared in the same VAT return.</p>
                            <p>The difference between the output tax and input tax reported by a taxable person in their
                                VAT
                                returns is either the net VAT payable to the FTA (if the output tax exceeds the input
                                tax) or
                                net VAT recoverable from the FTA (if the input tax exceeds the output tax) for that
                                specific tax

                            <p>As mentioned above, a person is only required to account for VAT in the UAE, if it is a
                                taxable
                                person – that is, if the person is either registered for VAT or is obligated to register
                                for
                                VAT. It is, therefore, necessary to determine when a person is required to be registered
                                for
                                VAT.</p>
                            <p>VAT registration may be either mandatory or voluntary. It should be noted that different
                                registration requirements and conditions may apply to both mandatory and voluntary
                                registrations
                                depending on whether a person has a place of residence in the UAE. As a consequence, it
                                is
                                important for a person to know whether or not it is resident in the UAE when considering
                                which
                                registration rules apply to it.</p>
                            <p>A person would have a place of residence in the UAE for the purposes of VAT registration
                                if the
                                person has a place of establishment or fixed establishment in the UAE. The terms are

                            <p>For a supply to be within the scope of the UAE VAT regime, the supply needs to take place
                                in the
                                UAE. If a supply takes place outside the UAE, the supply is treated as outside the scope
                                of UAE
                                VAT and therefore UAE VAT will not apply. Furthermore, such an out of scope supply would
                                not
                                count for the purposes of the registration thresholds discussed above.</p>
                            <p>In order to assist businesses in determining where a supply takes place, the VAT
                                legislation
                                provides a number of "place of supply" rules. These rules are different for goods and

                                goods and services in e-commerce arrangements are discussed in the subsequent parts of

                            <h3>2.6. Reverse charge mechanism</h3>
                            <p>Under the default VAT rule for accounting for VAT, a supplier of goods or services is
                                liable to
                                account for VAT on any taxable supply, irrespective of whether the supplier is a UAE
                                resident or
                                not.</p>
                            <p>The "reverse charge mechanism" is a simplification measure which allows non-resident
                                suppliers
                                to avoid the need to register for VAT in the UAE when they make supplies of goods or
                                services in
                                the UAE to registered persons.</p>
                            <p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the non-resident supplier will not charge VAT
                                to the
                                recipient. Instead, the VAT-registered recipient must self-account for the VAT in
                                respect of the
                                goods or services received. This means that the recipient must record the VAT on the
                                acquisition
                                as output tax at the applicable rate in their systems and declare it in their VAT
                                return. This
                                output tax may then be recovered by the recipient as input tax in accordance with the
                                normal input tax recovery rules as applicable
                                to that recipient.</p>
                            <p>The reverse charge mechanism applies in two scenarios. The first scenario applies to a
                                taxable
                                person where that taxable person imports non-exempt goods or services into the
                                UAE<sup><a href="#footnote8" id="ref8">[8]</a></sup> – in this context, "import" means
                                the arrival of goods from abroad into
                                the UAE or the receipt of services from outside the UAE<sup><a href="#footnote9"
                                        id="ref9">[9]</a></sup>. The second
                                scenario where the reverse charge mechanism applies is in situations where the place of
                                supply
                                of goods or services is in the UAE and the following conditions are met:<sup><a
                                        href="#footnote10" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the supply is a taxable supply;</li>
                                <li>the supplier's place of residence is outside the UAE;</li>
                                <li>the supplier does not charge VAT on that supply (i.e. the supplier is not already
                                    registered for VAT in the UAE);</li>
                                <li>the recipient's place of residence is in the UAE; and</li>
                                <li>the recipient is registered or required to register for VAT in the UAE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The purpose of the reverse charge mechanism is to reduce compliance and the
                                administrative
                                burden of collecting VAT from non-resident suppliers. It also puts the recipient in the
                                same
                                position as they would have been if they acquired the goods or services from a domestic
                                supplier, thereby ensuring that domestic UAE suppliers are not disadvantaged by VAT not
                                being
                                collected from purchases from abroad.</p>

                            <p>If the recipient of the supply is a taxable person and is registered for VAT then they
                                may be
                                able to recover the amount of VAT incurred if the necessary conditions, discussed below,
                                are
                                met. Recipients who are not taxable persons are not typically able to recover any VAT on
                                their
                                acquisitions, unless one of the special refund schemes applies.</p>
                            <p>The ability to recover VAT by a taxable person is subject to certain conditions. The
                                recovery of
                                input tax will be permitted where acquired goods and services are used, or intended to
                                be used,
                                in making any of the following:<sup><a href="#footnote11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>taxable supplies;</li>
                                <li>supplies that are made outside the UAE which would have been considered taxable had
                                    they
                                    been made in the UAE; and</li>
                                <li>supplies of financial services which would have been treated as exempt if made in
                                    the
                                    UAE, but which are provided to a person who is outside the UAE and are treated as
                                    taking
                                    place outside the UAE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Where any acquisition by a taxable person relates solely to the supplies indicated
                                above, the person will, generally, be able to recover the input tax incurred in full. In
                                contrast, where an acquisition is directly linked solely to non-business activities (for
                                example, private use) or exempt supplies (for example, certain supplies of financial
                                services) made by the taxable person, the taxable person will not be able to recover any
                                of the input tax incurred. Finally, where goods or services are used partly in the
                                course of making supplies that allow for the recovery of input tax and partly for making
                                supplies for which VAT is not recoverable, then the taxable person must determine the
                                portion of the input tax that can be recovered.</p>
                            <p>Any recoverable input tax can be recovered through a VAT return. A taxable person is
                                able to recover input tax in the first tax period in which both of the following
                                conditions are met:<sup><a href="#footnote12" id="ref12">[12]</a></sup></p>

                                <li>the taxable person has received and retained a tax invoice or other documentation
                                    evidencing the supply or import; and</li>
                                <li>the amount of VAT in question has been paid in whole or in part. It should be noted
                                    that the
                                    condition will also be met if the person intends to make the payment within six
                                    months
                                    of the due date of payment.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If the taxable person has not recovered input tax in the tax period in which the
                                conditions have
                                been met, the person will be able to recover this input tax in the following tax
                                period.<sup><a href="#footnote13" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>It should be noted that, where a taxable person accounts for VAT in respect of any
                                acquired
                                goods or services under the reverse charge mechanism in its VAT return, that VAT is
                                still the
                                person's input tax. As a consequence, the taxable person may consider whether it can
                                recover
                                this input tax under the normal input tax recovery rules discussed above, and can
                                recover it in
                                the appropriate VAT return, if appropriate.</p>

                    <article id="bookmarkSection3.1">
                        <h3>3.1. Introduction</h3>
                        <p>For the purposes of this Guide, a supply of goods in the e-commerce context involves
                            purchasing goods through an electronic platform, such as a website or a marketplace. Once
                            the goods are purchased, they are then delivered to the recipient.</p>

                        <p>Depending on the location of the supplier, the recipient, and the goods, the supply may take
                            any of the following basic forms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>A supply by a resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being delivered
                                    from either inside or outside the UAE;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>A supply by a resident supplier to a recipient outside the UAE, with goods being
                                    delivered from either inside or outside the UAE;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>A supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being
                                    delivered from either inside or outside the UAE; and</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>A supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient outside the UAE, with goods being
                                    delivered from either inside or outside the UAE.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In each of the above scenarios, the supplier has to consider the impact of VAT on the sale of
                            the goods. In addition, where the goods are physically imported into the UAE from outside
                            the UAE, the importer has to consider the impact of the VAT charged on import of the goods.
                        </p>

                        <p>Below we discuss the VAT treatment of sales of goods in more detail.</p>

                        <p>For the purpose of this guide, the UAE refers to the mainland UAE. This guide does not
                            consider supplies of goods to, from or within Designated Zones. Such supplies are discussed
                            separately in the Designated Zones VAT Guide | VATGDZ1.</p>

                        <p>The basic place of supply rule for goods is that, if the goods are located in the UAE when
                            supplied, then they are treated as supplied in the UAE. Similarly, if the goods are located
                            outside the UAE when they are supplied, the place of supply is outside the UAE. Where the
                            supply involves the export of goods from the UAE to a place outside the GCC Implementing
                            States (which is currently, any other state outside the UAE), the place of supply is in the
                            UAE.<sup><a href="#footnote14" id="ref14">[14]</a></sup></p>

                        <p>As such, a supplier has to consider where the goods are, and which of the place of supply
                            rule applies to a specific transaction. Below we consider various scenarios in more detail.

                        <p>This part discusses e-commerce arrangements where the sold goods are delivered from the UAE.

                            <h4>3.3.1. Imposition of VAT</h4>
                            <p>As mentioned in <a href="#bookmarkSection3.2" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 3.2</a>, where the goods are supplied wholly within
                                the UAE or are exported from the UAE to outside the Implementing States, the place of
                                supply of these goods will be the UAE.</p>

                            <p>It should be noted that goods are considered to be supplied in the UAE where the customer
                                receives the ownership or the right to dispose of the goods in the UAE. For example,
                                where a supplier imports goods into the UAE prior to transferring them to the recipient
                                in the UAE, the supply shall be treated as taking place in the UAE.</p>

                            <p>Where a taxable supply in the UAE is made by a supplier which is a taxable person (i.e.
                                the supplier is registered or required to register for VAT), the supplier has to
                                consider which VAT rate should be charged on the supply.</p>

                            <h5>Goods supplied locally</h5>
                            <p>The default VAT rate is 5%. This is the rate which applies to most goods which are sold
                                within the UAE.</p>

                            <p>There are, however, a number of goods which may be subject to the 0% VAT rate when sold
                                locally. In the e-commerce context, the most likely example of goods which may be
                                zero-rated when sold locally are qualifying pharmaceutical products and medical
                                equipment.<sup><a href="#footnote15" id="ref15">[15]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>Where goods are exported from the UAE, the supply may be eligible to be zero-rated as an
                                export in accordance with Article 30 of the Executive Regulation. The conditions for
                                zero-rating vary depending on which party is contractually responsible for arranging the

                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>It should be noted that one of the common conditions for zero-rating of exports is that
                                the supplier (in the case of a direct export) or the recipient (in the case of an
                                indirect export) must obtain official <b>and</b> commercial evidence of export.</p>

                            <p>"Official evidence" means export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department
                                in respect of goods leaving the UAE – in most Emirates, this would require the exporter
                                to retain a certificate issued by the relevant Customs Department confirming exit of
                                goods from the UAE (for example, an exit certificate or a similar document evidencing
                                the export).</p>

                            <p>On the other hand, "commercial evidence" refers to a document issued by commercial
                                parties which provides evidence of the transportation of the goods to outside the UAE.
                                Acceptable commercial evidence includes airway bills, bills of lading, consignment
                                notes, and certificate of shipments.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of the requirements to obtain official and commercial evidence of export is
                                to ensure that there is sufficient proof that the transaction has taken place and the
                                goods have actually left the UAE. As such, the official and commercial evidence of
                                export must identify the following:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the supplier;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the consignor;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the goods;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the value of the goods;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the export destination; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the mode of transport and route of the export movement.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Where the above conditions for zero-rating are not met, or if the goods in question are
                                not exported from the UAE or put into a customs suspension regime within the required
                                period of 90 days, the supplier should account for VAT on the supply at the default rate
                                of 5%.</p>

                            <p>If an exporter is of the view that it is impossible to obtain the evidence prescribed
                                under Article 30 of the Executive Regulation, then they may apply for an exception from
                                the FTA. Please refer to VAT Administrative Exceptions Guide | VATGEX1.</p>

                            <p>Typically, the responsibility for accounting for VAT on any supply of goods in the UAE
                                lies with the taxable supplier of goods.</p>

                            <p>As discussed in <a href="#bookmarkSection2.6" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2.6</a>, there may be situations when the obligation
                                to account for VAT passes to the recipient of the goods under the "reverse charge
                                mechanism". With respect to a taxable supply of goods that are already in the UAE, the
                                reverse charge mechanism applies where:<sup><a href="#footnote17"
                                        id="ref17">[17]</a></sup></p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the supplier does not have a place of residence in the UAE;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the supplier does not charge VAT on that supply, for example, where the supplier
                                        is not already registered for VAT in the UAE, and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the recipient is a taxable person with a place of residence in the UAE.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the recipient must account for VAT to the FTA
                                at the VAT rate applicable to the acquired goods. This VAT should be charged on the top
                                of the agreed price for the goods (i.e. the price is treated as VAT exclusive).<sup><a
                                        href="#footnote18" id="ref18">[18]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>It should be noted that the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the default rule
                                and therefore should only be used where the supplier can ascertain that all of the
                                conditions for the application of the reverse charge mechanism are satisfied. In order
                                to ensure that the reverse charge mechanism is not applied incorrectly, the non-resident
                                supplier should seek to collect information from the recipient regarding the recipient's
                                UAE residency and registration status. The supplier should also retain this information
                                for its records and in order to be able to substantiate the application of the reverse
                                charge mechanism in case of a tax audit. If the non-resident supplier cannot ascertain
                                all of the details necessary for the application of the reverse charge mechanism to a
                                supply, such as that the recipient is registered for VAT, then the supplier should
                                register for VAT in the UAE and account for VAT to the FTA itself.</p>

                            is also outside the UAE. Thus, if a supply of goods involves the goods being transferred to
                            the recipient outside of the UAE, the place of supply of the goods is outside the UAE, even
                            if the goods are subsequently imported into the UAE. This means that UAE VAT does not apply
                            to the supply of these goods.</p>

                        <p>This should be contrasted with situations where the goods are first imported into the UAE and
                            then supplied to the recipient – in such situations, the supply of the goods to the
                            recipient is treated as a local supply in the UAE with the place of supply in the UAE.</p>

                        <p>It should be noted that the physical importation of goods into the UAE would typically also
                            trigger the obligation on the importer (either the supplier or the recipient) to account for
                            import VAT. This is discussed in more detail in the next part of this Guide.</p>

                        <h3>3.5. VAT on import of goods into the UAE</h3>

                        <article id="bookmarkSection3.5.1">
                            <h4>3.5.1. Imposition and accounting for import VAT</h4>
                            <p>Where goods are imported into the UAE from overseas, the goods will be subject to import
                                VAT at 5%, unless the goods would be either zero-rated or exempt if supplied in the UAE.
                            </p>

                            <p>Import VAT is imposed on the customs value as calculated pursuant to Customs legislation,
                                including the value of insurance, freight and any customs fees and excise tax paid on
                                the import of the goods. Where the determination of such customs value is not possible,
                                then the value can be determined based on the alternate valuation rules stated in the
                                applicable Customs legislation.<sup><a href="#footnote19" id="ref19">[19]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>The obligation to account for import VAT is on the "importer", being the person whose
                                name is listed as the importer of the relevant goods for customs clearance purposes. The
                                mechanism for accounting for VAT on imported goods depends on the VAT registration
                                status of the importer at the time of importation.</p>

                            <h5>Deferred payment to the time of filing VAT return</h5>
                            <p>In certain situations, an importer may be able to account for VAT in the VAT return which
                                relates to the tax period in which the goods are imported. In order for this to occur,
                                the importer must meet the following conditions:<sup><a href="#footnote20"
                                        id="ref20">[20]</a></sup></p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the importer is registered for VAT at the time of import;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the importer has sufficient details for the FTA to verify the import and the VAT
                                        which is due on the import and is able to provide these as required;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the importer has provided the FTA with its own Customs registration number issued
                                        by the competent Customs department for the import in question; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the importer has cooperated with, and complied with any rules imposed by the FTA
                                        in respect of the import.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In practice, these conditions require that a VAT-registered importer registers their
                                Customs registration number with the FTA prior to importing goods into the UAE (this can
                                be done at the time of registering for VAT or at a later time). When any goods are
                                subsequently imported into the UAE by this importer using the Customs registration
                                number which is registered with the FTA, no VAT will be charged at the time of import
                                and the goods will be released to the importer as soon as other customs formalities are
                                completed. The applicable import VAT would then be prepopulated as output tax in box 6
                                of the importer's next VAT return. It should be noted that the importer has an ongoing
                                obligation to ensure that the VAT return reflects the correct VAT payable in respect of
                                the import – as a consequence, the importer should review the correctness of the import
                                VAT prepopulated in its VAT return and should make adjustments in box 7 of the VAT
                                return, if necessary.</p>

                            <p>VAT incurred on imports is treated as input tax of the importer, and the importer may be
                                able to recover it in box 10 of its VAT return, if eligible under the normal VAT
                                recovery rules as discussed in <a href="#bookmarkSection2.7" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2.7</a> of this Guide. Where the importer is entitled
                                to recover the input tax in full, it will not represent a cost to the business.</p>

                            <h5>Payment at the time of import</h5>
                            <p>In situations where the conditions for deferring the payment of import VAT are not met –
                                for example, the importer is not registered for VAT at the time of import – the importer
                                would need to pay VAT to the FTA before the goods can be released to it by the relevant
                                Customs department. This process requires the importer to use the FTA's e-Services
                                portal to complete the VAT301 – Import Declaration Form for VAT Payment and to make the
                                payment of applicable VAT.</p>

                            <p>Please refer to the VAT Import Declaration User Guide for detailed guidance regarding
                                accounting for import VAT by non-registered importers.</p>

                            <h4>3.5.2. Import with assistance of an import clearing agent</h4>
                            <p>Often, the task of importing goods into the UAE and fulfilling all importation
                                formalities are delegated to a clearing agent. For example, the task of clearing the
                                goods through Customs may be undertaken by a specialised clearing agent, a freight
                                forwarder responsible for delivering the goods to the purchaser, or a third party local
                                company.</p>

                            <p>Where a clearing agent or equivalent business is importing goods on behalf of a
                                VAT-registered importer, the clearing agent should declare the importer's TRN on the
                                customs import declaration. This will allow the importer to account for the import VAT
                                in its VAT return as described in <a href="#bookmarkSection3.5.1" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 3.5.1</a>.</p>

                            <p>On the other hand, where a clearing agent is importing goods on behalf of a
                                non-registered importer, the agent should declare its own TRN or C/O TRN<sup><a
                                        href="#footnote21" id="ref21">[21]</a></sup> on the customs import declaration
                                and should be responsible for the payment of VAT in respect of the import in its VAT
                                return.<sup><a href="#footnote22" id="ref22">[22]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>It should be noted that since the clearing agent or equivalent business is not the owner
                                of the goods, but simply facilitates the import of those goods into the UAE, <b>it
                                    should not recover the import VAT as its own input tax in the VAT return, and doing
                                    so would expose the clearing agent</b> or equivalent business <b>to an assessment
                                    for over-recovered VAT and penalties</b>. Instead, if the VAT is paid by the
                                clearing agent or equivalent business, it can be recovered by the agent directly from
                                the importer. To do so, the clearing agent or equivalent business must issue a statement
                                to the importer which contains, at the minimum, the following details:<sup><a
                                        href="#footnote23" id="ref23">[23]</a></sup></p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the name, address, and TRN of the clearing agent or equivalent business;</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>the date on which the statement is issued;</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>the date of import of the relevant goods;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>a description of the imported goods which is sufficient to identify them; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the amount of VAT paid by the agent to the FTA in respect of the imported goods.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It should be noted that the statement issued by the clearing agent is treated as a <i>de
                                    facto</i> tax invoice for VAT purposes. As a consequence, the importer is able to
                                rely on the statement to recover VAT if and when available (for example, if the
                                non-registered importer registers for VAT at a later date and it was eligible to recover
                                the input tax paid before registration).</p>

                            <p>The FTA requires all agents to retain copies of these statements, so that they are
                                available for inspection when the FTA undertakes audits of these agents' VAT accounts.

                            <p>Certain categories of goods are relieved from import VAT. In some cases, these categories
                                generally mirror reliefs which are available in respect of customs duties, therefore
                                allowing certain goods not to be subject to both VAT and customs duties.</p>

                            <h5>Import VAT suspension</h5>
                            <p>Goods are not treated as imported into the UAE where they are under customs duty
                                suspension arrangements in accordance with the GCC Common Customs Law under any of the
                                following categories:<sup><a href="#footnote24" id="ref24">[24]</a></sup></p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>temporary admission;</li>
                                <li>goods placed in a customs warehouse;</li>
                                <li>goods in transit; or</li>
                                <li>imported goods intended to be re-exported by the same person.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Where any of the above exceptions apply, the movement of goods into the UAE is not
                                treated as an import, and therefore not subject to import VAT. If any conditions for the
                                VAT suspension are subsequently broken, the goods may be treated as having been imported
                                into the UAE and the VAT will become due on the import from the date the goods were
                                originally imported.</p>

                            <p>In order to benefit from the above VAT exception, the importer is required to provide a
                                financial guarantee to the FTA for the amount of VAT chargeable in respect of the goods.
                                This guarantee will be refunded by the FTA once the goods leave the UAE in accordance
                                with the relevant customs suspension conditions. It should be noted that where an import
                                is facilitated by a clearing agent who has a TINCO registration, the TINCO agent can use
                                its own guarantee with the FTA, and ask the importer for a guarantee or cash deposit
                                which will be refunded once the goods leave the UAE.</p>

                            <h5>Import VAT exemption</h5>
                            <p>In certain situations, imports of goods into the UAE are fully exempt from VAT. The
                                exemption applies to goods which are treated as exempt from Customs duty under any of
                                the following categories:<sup><a href="#footnote25" id="ref25">[25]</a></sup></p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>goods imported by the military forces, and internal security forces;</li>
                                <li>personal effects and gifts accompanied by travelers;</li>
                                <li>used personal effects and household items transported by UAE nationals living abroad
                                    on return or expats moving to live in the UAE for first time; or</li>
                                <li>returned goods.</li>
                            </ol>



                            <p>The last of the above categories may apply in respect of goods which were sold and
                                exported from the UAE, but then returned to the supplier in the UAE. It should be noted
                                that this import exemption only covers import VAT and does not extend to VAT, if any,
                                which may have been originally charged by the supplier on the sale of the goods.</p>

                                        automatically delivered over the internet, an electronic network, or an

                                        <li>supply of advertising space on a website and any rights associated with such
                                            advertising;</li>
                                        <li>supply of political, cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational

                                        <li>live streaming via the internet;</li>
                                        <li>supply of distance learning; and</li>
                                        <li>services of an equivalent type which have a similar purpose and function.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>For a supply to fall under the special VAT rules for electronic services, the
                                        supply must, therefore, meet two conditions:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>the service in question must be one of the services mentioned in the above
                                            list of services; and</li>
                                        <li>the service must be automatically delivered over the internet, an electronic
                                            network, or an electronic marketplace.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>The first of these requirements means that a service will not be an electronic
                                        service where it is not one of the services listed above, even if the service is
                                        supplied using the internet or an electronic network. For example, a supply of
                                        legal or financial advice, transport services, or hotel accommodation will not
                                        constitute an electronic service simply because the parties use the internet to
                                        communicate with each other or to facilitate bookings.</p>

                                    <p>The second requirement means that an electronic service should be automatically
                                        delivered over the internet, an electronic network, or an electronic marketplace
                                        with minimal or no human intervention. Thus, although a small degree of human
                                        intervention is acceptable to enable or complete a supply, this intervention
                                        should not change the nature of the delivery of a service as being essentially
                                        automated. For example, where a recipient receives a manually generated email
                                        with a download link for the software which he has picked from the supplier's
                                        website, the software can be still considered automatically delivered – the
                                        human intervention of sending an email with a download link is too insignificant
                                        to change the nature of the supply.</p>

                                    <div class="example">
                                        <p>The above example can be contrasted with a situation where a recipient
                                            commissions customised software which has to be developed by the supplier
                                            before being put on the supplier's website to be available to the recipient.
                                            In this situation, the human involvement from the supplier in developing the
                                            software is critical to the supplier's ability to make the supply of
                                            services. As a consequence, the services cannot be treated as automatically
                                            delivered to the recipient.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <p>It should be noted that a supply of electronic services may be made through an
                                        electronic marketplace rather than directly by the supplier to the recipient.
                                        "Electronic marketplace" means a distribution service which is operated by
                                        electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, or
                                        distribution platform, and meets both of the following conditions:<sup><a
                                                href="#footnote27" id="ref27">[27]</a></sup></p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>it allows suppliers to make supplies of electronic services to recipients;
                                            and</li>
                                        <li>the supplies made by the marketplace must be made by electronic means.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Where a supplier makes a supply of electronic services through an electronic
                                        marketplace, and the electronic marketplace is not acting in a capacity as an
                                        undisclosed agent, then the supply is treated as made by the principal supplier
                                        directly to the recipient of the supply. On the other hand, where the electronic
                                        marketplace acts as an undisclosed agent for the principal supplier, there will
                                        be two supplies for VAT purposes – a supply by the principal supplier to the
                                        marketplace and the supply by the marketplace to the principal recipient. The
                                        VAT consequences of making supplies through agents, such as electronic
                                        marketplaces, are discussed in detail in <a href="#bookmarkSection5"

                                    <h3>4.2. Place of supply of electronic services</h3>
                                    <p>Supplies of electronic services (as well as of telecommunications services) are
                                        subject to a special place of supply rule. Thus, the place of supply of
                                        electronic services is:<sup><a href="#footnote28" id="ref28">[28]</a></sup></p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>in the UAE, to the extent of the use and enjoyment of the supply in the UAE;
                                            and</li>
                                        <li>outside the UAE, to the extent of the use and enjoyment of the supply
                                            outside the UAE.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>The reference to the "extent" in Article 31 indicates that a single supply may be
                                        apportioned for the purposes of a place of supply rules, so that it is treated
                                        as partly in the UAE and partly outside the UAE. This ability to apportion a
                                        supply is, however, limited to situations where a sufficient distinction exists
                                        between the different parts of the supply (i.e. services supplied) or
                                        consideration (amounts charged for such services) so as it is practical and
                                        reasonable to divide them.</p>

                                    <p>The actual use and enjoyment of electronic services should be determined on the
                                        basis of where the electronic services are consumed by the recipient, regardless
                                        of the place of contract or payment.<sup><a href="#footnote29"
                                                id="ref29">[29]</a></sup> Since the legislation does not provide any
                                        express rule regarding the indicators which should be used to determine the
                                        place of use and enjoyment, this determination must be made on a case-by-case
                                        basis, and all of the facts of the supply must be considered.</p>

                                    <p>Nevertheless, the following principles may be used as high-level guidance in
                                        determining the place of use and enjoyment in various scenarios:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>In the case of an electronic service which is delivered to a physical
                                                place, the place of use and enjoyment of that service is that physical
                                                place. For example, where electronic services content can be only
                                                accessed from a particular physical location, that location will be the
                                                place of use and enjoyment.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>In the case of electronic services provided on a portable device, the use
                                                and enjoyment may be determined on the basis of the recipient's location
                                                at the time the services are supplied. For example, where music is
                                                electronically delivered to a recipient located in the UAE, the place of
                                                use and enjoyment will be the UAE.</p>

                                            <p>For the purpose of determining the location of the recipient, some of the
                                                factors which may be indicative of the recipient's location are:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>the internet protocol ("IP") address of the device used by the
                                                    recipient to receive the electronic service;</li>
                                                <li>the country code stored on the SIM card used by the recipient to
                                                    receive the electronic service;</li>
                                                <li>the place of residence of the recipient;</li>
                                                <li>the billing address of the recipient; and/or</li>
                                                <li>the bank details used by the recipient for the payment.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>In determining the location of the recipient, the supplier should give priority

                                        place where the electronic services will be used and enjoyed. For example, if a
                                        KSA resident orders an on-demand film to be watched on a computer with an IP
                                        address in the UAE, the use and enjoyment of the film will be in the UAE.</p>

                                    <h3>4.3. Imposition of VAT</h3>
                                    <p>The place of supply of electronic services determines whether or not the services
                                        are subject to VAT in the UAE. Where the place of supply is outside the UAE, no
                                        UAE VAT would apply. In contrast, where the place of supply is in the UAE, the
                                        supply will fall within the UAE VAT net.</p>

                                    <p>The default VAT rate on a taxable supply of services in the UAE is 5%. The supply
                                        may, however, be zero-rated if it falls under any of the zero-rating scenarios
                                        in Article 45 of the Decree-Law. For example, a supply of an electronic service
                                        of distance learning which is automatically delivered over the internet may be
                                        zero-rated if it is covered by Article 45(13) of the Decree-Law, read with
                                        Article 40 of the Executive Regulation.</p>

                                    <p>Similar to supplies of goods discussed in <a href="#bookmarkSection3.3.2"
                                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 3.3.2</a> of this Guide, the
                                        responsibility for accounting for VAT on any taxable supply of electronic
                                        services in the UAE typically lies with the taxable supplier of those electronic
                                        services, unless the reverse charge mechanism applies.</p>

                                    <p>In respect of cross-border supplies of electronic services into the UAE (i.e.
                                        import of services into the UAE from abroad), the reverse charge mechanism
                                        applies where the supplier does not have a place of residence in the UAE and the
                                        recipient is either registered or required to register for VAT in the
                                        UAE.<sup><a href="#footnote30" id="ref30">[30]</a></sup></p>

                                    <p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies to a supply, the recipient, rather
                                        than the non-resident supplier, must account for the VAT to the FTA at the
                                        applicable VAT rate. The VAT should be charged on top of the agreed price for
                                        the electronic services.<sup><a href="#footnote31" id="ref31">[31]</a></sup></p>

                                    <p>Since the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the default rule of
                                        accounting for VAT, it should only be used where the supplier can ascertain that
                                        all of the conditions for the application of the reverse charge are met. If the
                                        non-resident supplier cannot ascertain the necessary particulars for the
                                        application of the reverse charge mechanism to a particular supply, then the
                                        responsibility to account for VAT remains with the supplier.</p>

                                    <p>Since the reverse charge mechanism is only applicable when specific conditions
                                        are met, taxable supplies from the same non-resident supplier of electronic
                                        services may be subject to different VAT accounting treatments – while a taxable
                                        supply made to a UAE taxable person would be subject to the reverse charge
                                        mechanism under Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law, the same supply made to a
                                        non-taxable person would not be subject to the reverse charge mechanism and
                                        would continue being the obligation of the supplier. As such, the supplier may
                                        continue being responsible for accounting for VAT on supplies which are not
                                        subject to the reverse charge mechanism.</p>

                                    <div class="example">
                                        <p>For example, if a non-resident supplier of cross-border electronic services
                                            makes supplies to both taxable and non-taxable persons, it will be liable to
                                            register for VAT and to account for UAE VAT on its supplies to non-taxable
                                            persons. However, tax on its supplies to taxable persons is the
                                            responsibility of its customers, who shall be responsible to account for VAT
                                            under Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law. Note that this treatment is only
                                            applicable to cross-border supplies of services, and the rules for goods are

                                    <h3>5.1. Introduction</h3>
                                    <p>In the context of e-commerce, supplies of goods and services are often made using
                                        electronic
                                        platforms, portals, gateway or marketplaces ("electronic marketplaces"). Such
                                        electronic
                                        marketplaces may sell goods or services themselves, as well as act as
                                        intermediaries between the
                                        supplier and the recipient of goods or services.</p>
                                    <p>Where an electronic marketplace makes any supplies of goods or services in its
                                        capacity as a
                                        principal supplier (for example, it buys and then sells goods), then the
                                        electronic marketplace
                                        is treated as the supplier of those goods or services for VAT purposes. As a
                                        consequence, the
                                        electronic marketplace would be required to comply with the VAT rules and
                                        obligations which are
                                        typically applicable to suppliers of those goods or services.</p>
                                    <p>Where an electronic marketplace is not acting as a principal supplier of goods or
                                        services, it
                                        may act as an intermediary which enables a sale of goods and services. For
                                        example, an
                                        electronic marketplace may be used to advertise products, make bookings, process
                                        payments, and
                                        arrange deliveries of goods and services.</p>
                                    <p>The VAT treatment of supplies using intermediaries will depend on the arrangement

                                    <h3>5.2. Types of agency arrangements</h3>
                                    <p>An agent is a person who acts on behalf of another person in respect of a
                                        specific task. In a
                                        commercial transaction, an agent can act on behalf of a supplier of goods or
                                        services, or on
                                        behalf of a recipient of goods or services, or both. In the context of
                                        e-commerce, an agent is
                                        typically an intermediary which is authorised by the principal supplier to act
                                        on its behalf in
                                        finding, and dealing with, customers.</p>
                                    <p>From a VAT perspective, a different VAT treatment applies to supplies made
                                        through disclosed and
                                        undisclosed agents. As a consequence, it is important to be able to determine
                                        whether or not an intermediary is acting as a disclosed or an undisclosed agent:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>A disclosed agent is an agent which acts on behalf and in the name of a
                                                principal. In
                                                disclosed agency situations, the recipient of the supply knows that it
                                                is dealing with
                                                an agent of a principal, even if the recipient may not have any direct
                                                communication
                                                with the principal.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>An undisclosed agent is an agent acting in its own name, where the
                                                customer has no
                                                knowledge, and cannot be reasonably expected to have knowledge, that the
                                                agent is acting
                                                on behalf of a principal. It should be noted that this situation is
                                                different from
                                                situations where no other principal is involved at all and the
                                                "intermediary" is a
                                                principal itself – in undisclosed agency situation, the agent is still
                                                acting on behalf
                                                of a principal.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In order to determine the existence and the disclosed / undisclosed nature of an
                                        agency
                                        relationship, the starting point is to analyse contractual arrangements between
                                        parties. The
                                        contractual arrangement should typically be taken as representative of the true
                                        relationship
                                        between parties unless it is clearly a sham or is fundamentally inconsistent
                                        with the reality of
                                        the actual transaction. In interpreting contractual arrangements, it is only
                                        necessary to
                                        consider information which has been made available to the parties at the time
                                        they entered the
                                        agreement. For example, the fact that there is an agency agreement between the
                                        principal
                                        supplier and the agent does not in itself imply that this fact should be known
                                        to an
                                        unsuspecting recipient of the supply.</p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that in some situations, a person may be described as an
                                        "agent", but will in
                                        practice make supplies of goods or services on its own account. For VAT
                                        purposes, such labels
                                        should be ignored and the person should be treated as a principal in respect of
                                        the relevant
                                        supplies.</p>

                                    <p>The VAT treatment of supplies made through agents differs depending on whether it
                                        is a disclosed
                                        or undisclosed agency.</p>

                                        <h4>5.3.1. Disclosed agency</h4>
                                        <p>In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Decree-Law, a supply of goods and
                                            services
                                            through an agent acting in the name of and on behalf of a principal, i.e.
                                            through a
                                            disclosed agent, is considered to be a supply by the principal and for his
                                            benefit.</p>
                                        <p>The above means that where an agent, such as an electronic marketplace, is
                                            acting as a
                                            disclosed agent of the principal supplier in respect of a supply of goods or
                                            services,
                                            then the supply of these goods or services is treated as made directly by
                                            the principal
                                            supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a result, the VAT obligations
                                            for the supply
                                            will remain with the principal supplier, and the principal supplier should
                                            account for
                                            this VAT in its tax return if required under the normal VAT rules.</p>

                                        <h5>VAT treatment of agency services</h5>
                                        <p>Where an agent is charging an agency fee or commission for its agency
                                            services, these
                                            agency services should be treated as a separate supply of services from the
                                            supply of
                                            the underlying goods or services.</p>
                                        <p>Where the place of supply of such agency services is in the UAE, the services
                                            are
                                            considered a taxable supply. It should be noted that the place of supply for
                                            agency
                                            services provided by agents must be determined independently from the place
                                            of supply of
                                            the underlying goods and services, and therefore can differ from the place
                                            of supply of
                                            such goods or services. For example, where a UAE agent provides agency
                                            services to a UAE
                                            supplier of electronic services which have a place of supply in the USA
                                            under the use
                                            and enjoyment rules, the place of supply of the agency services would still
                                            be in the
                                            UAE.</p>
                                        <p>The default VAT rate for a taxable supply of agency services in the UAE is
                                            5%. However,
                                            in certain situations, the services may be zero-rated where they are
                                            supplied to a

                                        <h4>5.3.2. Undisclosed agency</h4>
                                        <p>In accordance with Article 9(2) of the Decree-Law, a supply of goods and
                                            services
                                            through an agent acting in its name, i.e. through an undisclosed agent, is
                                            considered to
                                            be a direct supply by the agent and for his benefit.</p>
                                        <p>Where an undisclosed agent is involved in a supply of any goods or services,
                                            there are
                                            two simultaneous supplies of these goods or services for VAT purposes – a
                                            supply from the principal supplier to the undisclosed agent, and a supply
                                            from the undisclosed
                                            agent to the recipient of the supply. In effect, the undisclosed agent is
                                            treated as
                                            both the buyer and the seller of the goods or services.</p>
                                        <p>The simultaneous supplies means that both the principal supplier and the
                                            undisclosed
                                            agent must separately charge VAT applicable on the supply of the underlying
                                            goods or
                                            services, and must account for this VAT to the FTA in their own VAT returns.
                                            Where it is
                                            eligible under the general input tax recovery rules, the undisclosed agent
                                            may also
                                            recover the VAT which was charged to it by the principal supplier – this
                                            ensures that
                                            this VAT is not a cost to the agent.</p>

                                            agent can charge a separate agency fee or commission for the agency services
                                            to the
                                            principal, the agent must consider the VAT treatment of this services
                                            separately from
                                            the VAT treatment of the underlying supply of goods or services.</p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, where the agent is able to embed the fee as a mark-up to

                                            price of the goods or services, then the VAT treatment of the agency

                                            follow the VAT treatment of the underlying goods or services.</p>

                                    <h3>5.4. Tax invoice requirements</h3>
                                    <p>As a default rule, a VAT-registered supplier of a taxable supply of goods or
                                        services is required to issue an original tax
                                        invoice and deliver it to the recipient of the supply.<sup><a href="#footnote34"
                                                id="ref34">[34]</a></sup> This condition applies
                                        irrespective of whether the goods are sold directly or through an electronic
                                        marketplace.</p>
                                    <p>As an exception to the default rule, where a VAT-registered agent makes a supply
                                        of goods or services on behalf of a
                                        principal, the agent may issue a tax invoice in relation to that supply as if
                                        that agent had made the
                                        supply.<sup><a href="#footnote35" id="ref35">[35]</a></sup> A tax invoice issued
                                        by the agent must contain all the usual particulars
                                        required under Article 59 of the Executive Regulation, but may include the
                                        agent's, rather than the supplier's,
                                        details – in which case, the invoice should, however, contain a reference to the
                                        principal supplier (including
                                        the supplier's name and TRN) somewhere on the invoice.</p>
                                    <p>Only one tax invoice may be issued for any supply of goods or services.
                                        Therefore, this option is not available where the
                                        principal supplier has already issued a tax invoice. Similarly, where an agent
                                        has issued a tax invoice in
                                        respect of a supply made by the principal, the agent must ensure that the
                                        principal receives a copy of that tax
                                        invoice, and the principal should not issue its own tax invoice in respect of
                                        the same supply.</p>
                                    <p>It is important to note that where the invoice is issued by the agent, the supply
                                        is still treated as being made by
                                        the principal supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a consequence, the
                                        supplier has to account for the relevant VAT and must comply with all the
                                        record-keeping requirements in
                                        respect of the supply.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, it should be noted that where an agent is an undisclosed agent which is
                                        treated as making the supply under Article
                                        9(2) of the Decree-Law, the undisclosed agent has the responsibility to issue a
                                        tax invoice in its own name.</p>
