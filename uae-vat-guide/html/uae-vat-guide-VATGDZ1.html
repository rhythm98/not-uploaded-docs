                                    <h3>Short brief</h3>
                                    <p>VAT has been introduced with effect from 1 January 2018 in the UAE. As a general
                                        consumption tax on the supply of goods and services, it applies to those
                                        supplies which take place within the territorial area of the UAE.</p>
                                    <p>Historically, Free Zones have been excluded from the territorial scope of the
                                        UAE. For VAT purposes, this is not automatically the case. Only those Free Zones
                                        listed in a Cabinet Decision qualify for special VAT treatment and that special
                                        VAT treatment has certain limitations. These nominated Free Zones are known as
                                        Designated Zones for VAT purposes.</p>
                                    <p>Designated Zones are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>subject to strict control criteria;</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>required to have security procedures in place to control the movement of
                                                goods and people to and from the Designated Zone;</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>required to have Customs procedures to control the movement of goods into
                                                and out of the Designated Zone; and</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>treated as being outside the territory of the UAE for VAT purposes for
                                                certain supplies of goods.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The effect for businesses operating in Designated Zones will be that many
                                        supplies of goods will be outside the scope of UAE VAT, subject to strict
                                        criteria and detailed record keeping. However, supplies of services are subject
                                        to the normal UAE VAT rules.</p>
                                    <p>Strict qualifying criteria are applied to limit the use of the Designated Zones
                                        measure to those businesses for which it is designed, i.e. it is a measure to
                                        facilitate international trade on a VAT neutral basis and is not one designed to
                                        enable tax avoidance at any level.</p>

                            <h3>VAT treatment of Free Zones</h3>
                            <p>VAT is a general consumption tax imposed on most supplies of goods and services in the
                                UAE. By default, it is chargeable on supplies of goods and services throughout the
                                territorial area of the UAE.</p>
                            <p>This territorial area will also include those areas currently defined as both fenced and
                                non-fenced Free Zones.</p>
                            <p>For VAT purposes, both fenced and unfenced Free Zones are considered to be within the
                                territorial scope of the UAE &ndash; and therefore subject to the normal UAE VAT rules
                                &ndash; unless they fulfil the criteria to be treated as a Designated Zone as defined by
                                the Federal Decree-Law on VAT <sup><a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a>
                                </sup>and Executive Regulations <sup><a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
                                </sup>. Those Free Zones which are Designated Zones are treated as being outside of the
                                territory of the UAE for VAT purposes for specific supplies of goods.</p>
                            <p>In addition, there are special VAT rules in respect of VAT treatment of certain supplies
                                made within Designated Zones. The effect of these rules is that <em>certain
                                </em>supplies of <em>goods </em>made within Designated Zones are not be subject to UAE
                                VAT. In contrast, supplies of <em>services </em>made within Designated Zones are treated
                                in the same way as supplies of services in the rest of the UAE.</p>

                                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Free Zones meeting the criteria have been specifically
                                    identified by way of a Cabinet Decision as <strong>Designated Zones.</strong> Where
                                    a Free Zone is not a Designated Zone, it is treated like any other part of the UAE.

                            <h3>Identification of a Designated Zone</h3>
                            <p>A Designated Zone is an area specified by a Cabinet Decision as being a &ldquo;Designated
                                Zone&rdquo; <sup><a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a> </sup>. Free Zones
                                listed by the Cabinet Decision as being a Designated Zone can be found under the
                                Legislation tab on the FTA website (<a href='http://www.tax.gov.ae'>www.tax.gov.ae</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>Although an area might be identified as a Designated Zone, it is not automatically
                                treated as being outside the UAE for VAT purposes. There are several main criteria
                                <sup><a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a></sup> which must be met in order
                                for a Designated Zone to be treated as outside the UAE for VAT
                                purposes. These are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Designated Zone must be a specific fenced geographic area.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Designated Zone must have security measures and Customs controls in place to
                                        monitor the entry and exit of individuals and movement of goods to and from the
                                        Designated Zone.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The Designated Zone must have internal procedures regarding the method of
                                        keeping, storing and processing of goods within the Designated Zone.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The operator of the Designated Zone must comply with the procedures set out by
                                        the FTA.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>This means that where a Designated Zone has areas that meet the above requirements, and
                                areas that do not meet the requirements, it will be treated as being outside the UAE
                                only to the extent that the requirements are met.</p>
                            <p>In addition, should a Designated Zone change the manner of its operation or no longer
                                meet any of the conditions imposed on it which led to it being specified as a Designated
                                Zone by way of the Cabinet Decision, it shall be treated as though it is located within
                                the territory of the UAE <sup><a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a> </sup>.

                            <div class='example'>
                                <p><b>Important: </b>Only where a Designated Zone meets <u>all</u> the above tests it
                                    can be treated as outside the UAE for VAT purposes.</p>

                            <h3>Entities within a Designated Zone</h3>
                            <p>Those businesses which are established, registered or which have a place of residence
                                within the Designated Zone are deemed to have a place of residence in the UAE for VAT
                                purposes <sup><a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a> </sup>.</p>
                            <p>The effect of this is that where a business is operating in a Designated Zone, it itself
                                will be onshore for VAT purposes, even though some of its supplies of goods may be
                                outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p>

                            <h3>VAT registration</h3>
                            <p>Any person carrying on a business activity in the UAE and making taxable supplies in
                                excess of the mandatory VAT registration threshold (i.e. a taxable person) must apply to
                                be registered for VAT purposes.</p>
                            <p>Any other person that is making taxable supplies or incurring expenses (which are subject
                                to VAT), in excess of the voluntary VAT registration threshold may apply to register for
                                VAT purposes.</p>
                            <div class='example'>
                                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Designated Zone businesses are considered to be
                                    established &rsquo;onshore&apos; in the UAE for VAT purposes. This means that they
                                    have the same obligations as non-Designated Zone businesses and have to register,
                                    report and account for VAT under the normal rules. It also means they can join a tax
                                    group (VAT group) provided they meet the required conditions.</p>

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>As outlined above, in certain instances, an area of a Designated Zone will be effectively
                                treated as &rsquo;offshore&apos; for VAT purposes, i.e. as if it is outside of the
                                territory of the UAE for the purposes of the tax. Since UAE VAT only applies on supplies
                                made in the UAE, such special treatment of Designated Zones will affect the VAT
                                treatment of supplies made within Designated Zones.</p>
                            <p>This section of the Guide discusses the consequences of treating Designated Zones as
                                being outside the UAE for various types of transactions.</p>

                            <h3>Supply of services</h3>
                            <p>The place of supply of services is considered to be within the UAE if, under the normal
                                rules, the place of supply would be the Designated Zone <sup><a href='#bookmark7'
                                        id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a> </sup>.</p>
                            <p>This override to the normal place of supply of services rules means that, in all
                                circumstances, the place of supply of services supplied in Designated Zones reverts to
                                being in the UAE. Such supplies are then taxed in accordance with the general VAT rules
                                for supplies of such services.</p>
                            <p>This means that most services will be liable to VAT at the standard rate, as would be the
                                case were they performed within the UAE. Equally, where services are exported (i.e. made
                                to a person who is resident and located outside the GCC Implementing States), then the
                                services may be zero-rated.</p>

                            <h3>Supply of goods within a Designated Zone</h3>
                            <p>As outlined above, Designated Zones will be treated as being &rsquo;offshore&apos; if the
                                necessary conditions are met.</p>
                            <section class='level-3'>

                                    <h3>Default rule</h3>
                                    <p>Since the place of supply for goods generally follows the location of the goods,
                                        a supply of goods within a Designated Zone is treated as made outside the UAE.
                                        This means that the default position is that such supplies are not subject to
                                        UAE VAT.</p>
                                </article>

                                    <h3>Override of the default rule</h3>
                                    <p>This default position is overridden where a supply of goods is made within a
                                        Designated Zone to a person to be consumed by him or another person &ndash; in
                                        these situations, the place of supply will be treated in the UAE and VAT will be
                                        applicable under the normal rules.</p>
                                    <p>In the above context, the term &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; should be interpreted
                                        broadly as including any utilisation, application, employment, deployment or
                                        exploitation of the goods. For the purpose of the provision, the resale of
                                        purchased goods is not treated as consumption of the goods. Therefore, a supply
                                        of goods in such circumstances would still be outside the scope of VAT if the
                                        purchaser intends to sell them.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that the override does not apply, and the supply
                                        can still be treated as being outside the scope of VAT, when the purchased goods
                                        are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>incorporated into, attached to or otherwise form part of another good
                                                located in the same Designated Zone and that other good is not consumed;
                                                or</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>used in the production of another good located in the same Designated
                                                Zone and that other good is not consumed.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>For the purposes of the second exception to the override, there must be a direct
                                        connection between the purchased goods and the production of another good. For
                                        example, the exception will generally apply to tools and equipment used to
                                        manufacture other goods; in contrast, a computer used by the business to create
                                        designs for goods which are later manufactured will not have sufficient
                                        connection with the goods to be treated as &ldquo;used in the production&rdquo;
                                        of the goods.</p>
                                    <p>The following are some of the examples of the application of <a

                                    <h3>Identification of the intended use of goods</h3>
                                    <p>The onus is on the supplier to ensure that it treats a supply correctly for VAT
                                        purposes. Therefore, as a general rule, suppliers should not treat supplies of
                                        goods as being outside the scope of UAE VAT unless they are satisfied that there
                                        is no risk that the goods may be used by the purchaser for non-qualifying
                                        purposes.</p>
                                    <p>The Authority expects that in most arm-length situations, a written statement
                                        from the recipient that the goods will not be consumed should be sufficient for
                                        these purposes.</p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that in many situations, the reasons behind the purchase
                                        should be clear from the context. For example, food sold by a grocery store
                                        within a Designated Zone are unlikely to be used for anything other than
                                        consumption by the purchaser or a third party.</p>

                                    <p>Since Designated Zones are treated as outside the UAE for VAT purposes, a
                                        movement or supply of goods into a Designated Zone from outside the UAE would be
                                        treated as taking place outside the UAE. Therefore, no UAE VAT would be charged

                                    <p>It should be noted, however, that there may be situations when goods were subject
                                        to VAT when purchased within the Designated Zone, and then subject to VAT again
                                        when imported by the same person into the mainland UAE.</p>
                                    <p>Where a VAT registered person has incurred VAT on purchase of goods within a
                                        Designated Zone and then again on import of the same goods from the Designated
                                        Zone into the mainland, the VAT registered person will be able to recover VAT
                                        incurred on the importation of the goods into the mainland in full (irrespective
                                        of the person&apos;s normal input tax recovery percentage) on its tax
                                        return<span>.</span></p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that import VAT can only be recovered in respect of the goods
                                        under this special rule if the same goods were subject to VAT when purchased by
                                        the importer in the Designated Zone, and that there were no intervening
                                        transactions in respect of the goods between the purchase by the importer and
                                        the actual import. The importer is required to retain evidence (and provide it
                                        to the Authority, if requested) of the VAT incurred in respect of the purchase
                                        and import.</p>

                                    <p>It is important to remember that even if VAT is charged on the import of goods
                                        into the UAE mainland from the Designated Zone, VAT may also be charged again on

                                        that sale (i.e. if it is a taxable supply made by a taxable person). Whether or
                                        not VAT is charged on such a sale will depend on whether or not the date of
                                        supply is triggered in respect of the sale when the goods are in the Designated
                                        Zone or following their importation into the mainland. The date of supply has to
                                        be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                            <h3>Supplies of water and energy</h3>
                            <p>Supplies of water or any form of energy are supplies of goods. Therefore, similar to
                                supplies of other goods within Designated Zones, such supplies may be treated as being
                                outside the scope of the UAE if they meet conditions discussed in part 3.3 of this
                                Guide.</p>
                            <p>However, where water or energy is supplied for consumption (e.g. water and electricity
                                provided by a water and electricity authority), then the place of supply of such water
                                and energy reverts to being treated as being within the UAE <sup><a href='#bookmark14'
                                        id='bookmarkback14'>[14]</a> </sup>and the supply is subject to the normal VAT
                                treatment. This override applies even if the water or energy is used in the process of
                                production of other goods in the Designated Zone. This means that suppliers of water and
                                energy shall charge VAT without the need to distinguish between the potential uses for
                                water and energy.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of the rule, the term &ldquo;energy&rdquo; includes electricity and gas,
                                including biogas, coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, oil gas, producer gas,
                                refinery gas, reformed natural gas, and tempered liquefied petroleum gas, and any
                                mixture of gases, whether used for lighting, or heating, or cooling, or air conditioning
                                or any other purpose. <sup><a href='#bookmark15' id='bookmarkback15'>[15]</a></sup></p>
                            <p>It should be noted that the rule only applies to water and energy sold for the purpose of
                                consumption. Supplies of oil, gas, and other similar goods traded by businesses within
                                Designated Zones may still be outside the scope of UAE VAT if the necessary conditions
                                are met.</p>

                            <h3>Supplies of real estate</h3>
                            <p>Supplies of real estate, which include the sale and lease of real estate, are treated as
                                supplies of goods. The place of supply of such supplies is where the real estate is
                                located.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that real estate is not treated as consumed when sold or leased within
                                a Designated Zone and therefore such supplies of real estate are not brought into the
                                scope of UAE VAT by <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-51'>Article 51</a>(5) of the
                                Executive Regulations. As such, supplies of real estate made within Designated Zones are
                                outside the scope of VAT.</p>
                            <p>In light of the above, raw materials purchased within a Designated Zone for the purpose
                                of constructing real estate in the Designated Zone are also outside the scope of VAT.
                                This is because the raw materials will be used in the production of another good (the
                                real estate) located in the same Designated Zone which itself is not consumed.</p>
                            <p>Where real estate is not supplied by way of sale or a lease, it is a supply of services
                                related to real estate. This includes, but is not limited to granting a personal right
                                to use real estate, licences to occupy real estate, the provision of contractual rights
                                exercisable over or in relation to real estate, including the right to use accommodation
                                in a hotel or similar establishment, and similar <sup><a href='#bookmark16'
                                        id='bookmarkback16'>[16]</a> </sup>.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier in this Guide, the place of supply of <u>all</u> services is
                                considered to be within the UAE if, under the normal rules, the place of supply would be
                                within a Designated Zone. <sup><a href='#bookmark17' id='bookmarkback17'>[17]</a>
                                </sup>As a result, supplies of services related to real estate will be taxable even if
                                supplied within a Designated Zone.</p>
                        </article>

                            <h3>Tax groups (VAT groups)</h3>
                            <p>For tax grouping purposes, a business established within a Designated Zone (which is
                                still treated as a UAE business) is able to form a tax group with an onshore company (or
                                companies) or another Designated Zone company (or companies), subject to meeting the
                                normal control criteria.</p>
                            <p>The usual consequences of tax grouping follow, such as supplies between members being
                                disregarded for VAT purposes, and there being joint and several liability of the members
                                of the tax group.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted, however, that where a supply of goods between the tax group members
                                results in the goods being moved from a Designated Zone into the UAE mainland, this
                                importation of the goods would trigger the obligation to pay import VAT. The payment of
                                import VAT will be done using the normal process for such payments &ndash; that is, a
                                VAT registered tax group will be able to defer accounting for the VAT to its VAT return.

                            <h3>Branches</h3>
                            <p>A single entity may have a branch or head office located in a Designated Zone and a
                                branch or head office located in the UAE mainland.</p>
                            <p>Supplies between different parts of the same legal entity, for example, between the head
                                office and the branch, are treated as intra-entity supplies for VAT purposes and
                                therefore disregarded.</p>
                            <p>Similar to the tax groups, it should be noted that a movement of goods from a Designated
                                Zone into the mainland UAE may trigger the obligation to pay import VAT (e.g. when
                                transferring goods from the branch in the Designated Zone to the head office in the
                                mainland). <span>A</span>VAT registered entity will be able to defer accounting for
                                import VAT to its VAT return; in contrast, an unregistered entity would be required to
                                make a payment of import VAT before the goods are released from the Designated Zone.</p>

                            <p>Businesses operating in Designated Zones will be subject to the normal VAT rules of VAT
                                recovery on their expenses:</p>

                                        liable to VAT if they were taking place in the UAE), it should be able to
                                        recover its VAT on expenses (input tax) in full.</p>

                                        (e.g. exempt supplies), the business is unable to recover VAT on expenses
                                        directly attributable to making such supplies.</p>

                                        those that do not, the business would be required to apportion the input tax in
                                        order to identify the recoverable part.</p>
