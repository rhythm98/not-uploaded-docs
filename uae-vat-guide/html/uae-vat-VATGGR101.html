                                        <p>Tax grouping for VAT purposes is an administrative easement available to businesses 
                                            and a revenue protection measure for government:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Creating a tax group has the effect of registering a single taxable person.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>A tax group is issued one VAT Tax Registration Number (TRN) for use by all 
                                                    group members, and only one tax return is required for all group members.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Transactions taking place within a tax group are generally disregarded for VAT 
                                                    purposes, meaning that cash-flow or absolute VAT costs that might otherwise 
                                                    be suffered by the businesses concerned are eliminated. Moreover, revenue 
                                                    risks that might otherwise arise on significant intra-group transactions are also 
                                                    eliminated.</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Strict qualifying criteria must be applied to limit the use of the measure to those for 
                                            which it is designed i.e. it is an administrative simplification measure, not one designed 
                                            to enable tax avoidance at any level.</p>

                                            a tax group, adding members to or removing members from an existing tax group, and

                                        <h3>Business criteria</h3>

                                    Each member must be carrying on a business. Broadly, a business is defined as any 
activity carried on in any place (i.e. in the UAE or elsewhere) regularly (i.e. the activity 
is not a one-off event) and independently (i.e. by a business, not its employees).

                                   <p>Generally, this means that a person that is not in business cannot form or join a tax

                                        <h3>Legal person criteria</h3>
                                        <p>Each member of a tax group must be a legal person (i.e. they must be a company, 
                                            government entity, or similar).</p>
                                            <p>A legal person is an entity that has legal personality formed under the relevant laws 
                                                that is capable of entering into contracts in its own name. Typically, for example, a 
                                                company would be a legal person, as it is formed under companies law and can enter 
                                                into contracts. However, it is also possible for other entities to be created which are 
                                                similar (e.g. the companies formed by Decree under local laws in the Emirates).</p>

                                            business establishment or as a consequence of having a fixed establishment in the 
                                            country. A business establishment is usually the place where key management 
                                            decisions affecting a business are made. A fixed establishment is a place which 
                                            possesses the necessary human and technical resources sufficient to carry on a 
                                            business.</p>
                                            <p>A foreign-owned subsidiary that has been established in the UAE can, under these 
                                                criteria, qualify to be included in a tax group. A branch of a foreign-owned company 
                                                can also qualify under the fixed establishment test. </p>
