                                        defined in the VAT legislation as any supply of goods or services for

                                        Directorship services would not be a supply of goods, and therefore is a

                                        To be a taxable supply, services must usually be provided for
                                        consideration.
                                        &ldquo;Consideration&rdquo; is all that is received or expected to be received for

                                        supply of the services, irrespective of whether in money or other forms
                                        of

                                    <p>The third
                                        condition is that services must be provided by a person in the course of
                                        conducting business. The VAT legislation defines &ldquo;business&rdquo; as any
                                        activity
                                        conducted regularly, on an ongoing basis and independently by any
                                        person, in any
                                        location such as industrial, commercial, agricultural, professional,
                                        service or
                                        excavation activities or anything related to the use of tangible or
                                        intangible
                                        properties. This is a very broad definition, which may encompass most
                                        activities
                                        which are conducted regularly and independently. As a consequence,
                                        directorship
                                        activities would be able to be performed in the course of conduct of
                                        business.

                                        The identification of whether or not services are provided in the UAE is
                                        done on
                                        the basis of place of supply rules. The default rule, subject to certain
                                        exceptions for cross- border supplies, is that the services are treated
                                        as
                                        taking place where the supplier is located. Therefore, generally,
                                        director&apos;s
                                        services provided by UAE residents will be treated as taking place in
                                        the UAE.

                                    <p>Finally,
                                        directorship services are not an exempt supply.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        &ldquo;<em><u>Taxable person</u></em>&rdquo;</p>

                                    <p>A &ldquo;taxable
                                        person&rdquo; is defined in the VAT legislation as any person registered or
                                        obligated
                                        to register for tax purposes.</p>

                                    <p>A person is
                                        required to register for VAT if the total value of their taxable
                                        supplies and
                                        imports have exceeded the mandatory registration threshold of AED
                                        375,000 in the
                                        preceding 12 months, or will exceed the threshold in the next 30 days.
                                        As
                                        discussed above, such calculation would include taxable supplies of
                                        director
                                        services.</p>

                                    <p>A director may
                                        also choose to voluntarily register for VAT where the value of taxable
                                        supplies
                                        (including director fees) exceed the voluntary registration threshold of
                                        AED
                                        187,500.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In conclusion, assuming a person provides services as a director
                                        regularly and
                                        independently (that is, they are not simply an employee of the company),
                                        the
                                        person will be required to charge VAT on their services.</p>

                                    <h3>Common director</h3>
                                    <p>An individual may act as a
                                        director of a number of companies. For convenience, one company may pay all the
                                        director&apos;s fees and then allocate the costs to recover appropriate proportions
                                        from the
                                        others.</p>

                                    <p>The individual&apos;s services,
                                        such as attending meetings or approving expenditure, are supplied by the
                                        individual to
                                        the companies of which they are a director. The services are supplied directly
                                        to the
                                        relevant businesses by the individual and not from one company to another. In
                                        this case,
                                        there is no supply between the companies and accordingly, no VAT is due on the
                                        share of
                                        money recovered from each company.</p>

                                    <h3>Right to a director</h3>
                                    <p>This often occurs in situations where one company
                                        is investing in another and is exercising a legal or contractual right to
                                        appoint a director to the board of the
                                        company in which they are investing. The director is usually selected because of
                                        their specialised knowledge and
                                        is appointed to give expert advice to the other company.</p>

                                    <p>Typically, a fee is charged by the company
                                        appointing the director and is paid by the company to which the director has
                                        been appointed. This fee should be
                                        treated as consideration for a taxable supply made by the director&apos;s original
                                        company and the fee is subject to
                                        VAT.</p>
