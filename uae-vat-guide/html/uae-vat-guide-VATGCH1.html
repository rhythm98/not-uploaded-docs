                                        has been introduced with effect from 1 January 2018 in the UAE. As a general
                                        consumption
                                        tax on the supply of goods and services, its effects must be understood by
                                        charities in
                                        the UAE in two contexts:</p>

                                            <p>the approach
                                                that should be taken by charities in the UAE when determining the amount
                                                of VAT
                                                on costs (i.e. input tax) which they are eligible to reclaim,
                                                specifically where
                                                they are engaged in both business and non-business activities (for

                                                as where they provide goods or services without charging for these).</p>

                                        certain charities in the UAE will be treated as designated charities. Where
                                        designated in that manner, designated charities will be entitled to recovery of
                                        VAT under a special regime.</p>

                                    <p>VAT is
                                        a general consumption tax imposed on most supplies of goods and services in the
                                        UAE. In
                                        that respect it will, by default, be chargeable on goods and services supplied
                                        by
                                        charities in the UAE where the charity is registered for VAT.</p>

                                        Charities will therefore be subject to the usual rules of VAT regarding the

                                        supplies. For further details on the general VAT rules, please refer to the

                                        VAT liabilities. Where such goods and services are supplied for a charge, this
                                        is a
                                        business activity which may result in the making of a taxable supply for VAT
                                        purposes
                                        and VAT will have to be charged where the charity is considered to be a taxable

                                        normal course of their operation, charities often receive donations of goods and
                                        services and may then use these as part of their onward provision of charitable
                                        activities. Where these activities are undertaken, and a charge is made, this is
                                        also a
                                        business activity for VAT purposes and VAT may be required to be charged.</p>

                                    <p>Since the relevant goods
                                        or services would be received by a charity free of charge, the charity will not
                                        have
                                        incurred any costs in relation to these and accordingly, there will be no VAT on

                                        to recover in such circumstances.</p>

                                    <p>All charities must comply with the Decree-Law No. 20 of

                                        an activity is performed by a charity that is acting in its charitable capacity
                                        (“relevant charitable activity”), and it makes no charge for the supply of goods
                                        or
                                        services concerned, the activity would ordinarily not be treated as being liable
                                        to UAE
                                        VAT as there is no charge, unless the supply is treated as a deemed supply
                                        (please see
                                        below).</p>

                                    <p>It is worth noting that
                                        in some cases the relevant charitable activity will be subsidised by grants or
                                        donations. Provided the grantor is not entitled to any benefit in return for the
                                        grant
                                        or donation (beyond a simple acknowledgement), no VAT would be chargeable as
                                        this is not
                                        a supply for consideration.</p>

                                    <p>Ordinarily, no VAT on direct costs incurred to receive
                                        such free provision of goods and services would be recoverable by the charity in
                                        such
                                        circumstances. However, certain designated charities will be entitled to recover
                                        VAT
                                        relating to their relevant charitable activities where they make such free
                                        provision of
                                        services and goods under a special VAT refund scheme.</p>

                                        though no supply of goods or services was actually made for consideration by
                                        that
                                        person. In this regard, the Decree-Law and Executive Regulations specifically

                                        provision for certain supplies to be deemed to be made by the taxable person.
                                        Such
                                        deemed supplies are generally subject to VAT at the standard rate but can also

                                        subject to VAT at the zero rate, depending on the circumstances .</p>

                                        activities of the charities often require goods and services to be given away or

                                        for non-business purposes, charities have to consider whether the deemed supply

                                    <p>For purposes of the
                                        above, the FTA considers a broad interpretation of the term &#39;business&#39;
                                        for VAT
                                        purposes which may include a charity using goods and services within the terms
                                        of its
                                        charitable activity. Therefore, where goods or services are used for such
                                        charitable
                                        purposes – e.g. property made available for free for events or kitchen
                                        appliances used
                                        in providing free meals – then this is not a deemed supply for VAT purposes if
                                        the
                                        relevant goods and services remain part of the assets of the charity.</p>

                                    <p>If the charity claims
                                        VAT in respect of the acquisition of goods and then gives the goods away for
                                        free, the
                                        supply will be treated as a deemed supply for VAT purposes if the charity
                                        recovered
                                        input tax in respect thereof. For example, where a charity has purchased food
                                        and then
                                        donated it to the poor, the charity should account for the output
                                        tax on the deemed supply of the food if the charity recovered input tax when the
                                        goods
