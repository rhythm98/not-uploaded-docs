                        Suppliers of certain services are able to claim a refund of the amount of VAT which they charge
                        on
                        supplies of these services to their international customers. There are a number of conditions
                        which have
                        to be met for the ability to reclaim the VAT to arise, including that the supplier should not
                        collect
                        the VAT component from the relevant international customers. The effect of these rules is that
                        the
                        international customers will not bear the cost of VAT when acquiring qualifying exhibition and
                        conference services.</p>
                    <p>The services which fall

                    <h3>Registration requirements in the UAE for International Customers</h3>
                    <p>The VAT
                        refund scheme described in this guide only applies where the relevant Services are provided to
                        customers who
                        <b>are not resident </b>in the UAE and <b>are not registered or required to register </b>for VAT
                        in the UAE.
                        Therefore, the ability to receive the refund will be lost if the customer is required to
                        register for VAT in the
                        UAE – which could happen, for example, if the non-resident customer started making supplies in
                        the UAE.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, the
                        International Customer may be selling goods / services during the Exhibition or Conference. This
                        triggers an
                        obligation for the Customer to register for VAT and account for VAT on the supplies, therefore
                        making it
                        ineligible to obtain Exhibition and Conference Services under the VAT refund scheme.</p>
                    <p>For example,
                        where the non-resident event organiser is selling tickets to resident and non-resident
                        customers, the
                        international event organiser must register with the FTA and collect VAT from the UAE residents.
                        A licence will
                        still be provided to the non-resident event organiser to be able to provide VAT refund to the
                        non-resident
                        customers. However, due to the VAT registration, the non-resident event organiser will not be
                        able to receive a
                        VAT refund themselves in respect of any space provided to them by a licensed hotel, but such VAT
                        may then be
                        deducted on their VAT return.</p>

                        <p><strong>Note</strong>:
                            there is no minimum threshold for non-resident suppliers of goods
                            and services in the UAE – that is, such suppliers may be required to register for VAT if
                            they make any
                            taxable supplies in the UAE.</p>
