                                In conducting its business activities, a person may incur expenses which are subject to
                                VAT (VAT
                                incurred by a person is called 'input tax'). This VAT can be recovered by a taxable
                                person,
                                subject to certain conditions being met. Consequently, VAT should, generally, not be a
                                cost to a
                                taxable person where such expenditure is incurred to make taxable supplies. However,
                                where the
                                taxable person is not able to recover the VAT incurred in respect of goods or services,
                                the
                                person is, in effect, treated as the end-consumer of those goods or services, and VAT
                                becomes a
                                cost to the business.

                            <p>The FTA accepts that the standard method of input tax apportionment may not be
                                appropriate for the particular situation of every registrant. Each business is
                                different, and the standard method of apportionment may give rise to outcomes that
                                do not reflect the actual use of goods or services by the business. In such cases,
                                registrants may apply for an alternative method of input tax apportionment to be
                                used.<sup><a href='#footnote12' id='ref12'>[12]</a></sup> If a special input tax
                                apportionment method is approved by the FTA, the registrant shall apply the approved
                                method from the first tax period following the tax period in which the approval was
                                granted by the FTA.<sup><a href='#footnote13' id='ref13'>[13]</a></sup></p>

                            <p>The special input tax apportionment methods which are available to registrants are:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Outputs-based method;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Transaction count method;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Floorspace method and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Sectoral method.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Not every special input tax apportionment method will be available to every business.
                                Instead, specific special input tax apportionment methods will generally be
                                available only to businesses from certain industry sectors.</p>

                            <p>Chapter 3 of this Guide provides guidance on each of the alternative input tax
                                apportionment methods, and the types of businesses which may apply with FTA to use
                                them.</p>

                            <p>Where a special method is approved, it will be applied for each tax period following
                                the date of approval as well as for the annual wash-up adjustment in the first tax
                                period of the following tax year. Furthermore, on the basis that the special method
                                is based on actual use, no actual use adjustment will be required in respect of tax
                                years following the approval as long as the FTA approval remains valid. The approval
                                will typically be granted for 4 years in the in the case of a non-sectoral method and
                                for 2 years in the case
                                of the sectoral method.</p>

                                        The outputs-based method determines the apportionment percentage
                                        for residual input tax
                                        on the basis of the types of supplies made by the taxable
                                        person.
                                    </p>

                                        To calculate the recovery ratio under this method, the
                                        registrant needs to identify the
                                        value of taxable supplies as a proportion of all supplies made
                                        by the taxable person.
                                    </p>

                                        This method is appropriate where the VAT incurred by a business
                                        is mostly directly linked to
                                        income earned, i.e. where there is a strong correlation between
                                        income and expenses.

                                        The transaction count method is used when the VAT on expenses
                                        incurred by the business is
                                        most directly linked to the number of transactions (i.e.
                                        supplies made) rather than the
                                        amount of income earned – that is, where the level of expense
                                        would be similar
                                        regardless of the value of the supplies being made. This method
                                        will only be appropriate
                                        if the nature of the transactions is such that each transaction
                                        is either wholly taxable
                                        or wholly exempt. Any transactions with both taxable and exempt
                                        components should be
                                        excluded from the calculation. In order to use this method, the
                                        registrant is required
                                        to accurately define the type of transactions as well as the
                                        related tax treatment in
                                        order to provide a clear audit trail to support the
                                        apportionment calculation. The
                                        registrant is, therefore, required to ensure that their
                                        accounting or management system
                                        is able to identify and track the different types of
                                        transactions.

                                        The floorspace method determines the apportionment percentage
                                        for residual input tax by
                                        identifying the proportion of the floorspace used for taxable
                                        activities as a percentage
                                        of the total floorspace used by the business, excluding areas
                                        used for both taxable and
                                        non-taxable purposes.

                                        The measuring unit used for the nominator and denominator should
                                        be consistent, e.g. if
                                        using m<sup>2</sup> for nominator, m<sup>2</sup> should also be
                                        used for denominator.

                                        The floorspace method is used when it is possible to identify
                                        whether a specific area is
                                        used for a taxable or non-taxable / exempt activity.

                                        Large complex businesses may conduct different business
                                        activities through different
                                        divisions which are independent of each other from an
                                        operational and accounting
                                        perspective. For example, a bank may have different divisions
                                        dealing with retail
                                        customers and investment banking; or an insurance company may,
                                        in addition to its core
                                        business, have a real estate division which deals with renting
                                        out properties.
                                    </p>

                                        Where such business activities are conducted through distinct
                                        divisions of a single
                                        entity, and different expenses relate to activities of these
                                        divisions, none of the
                                        special apportionment methods may be suitable for apportioning
                                        input tax for the
                                        business as a whole. To ensure that the apportionment method is
                                        as tailored as possible
                                        for each of the distinct business divisions, such businesses may
                                        apply for a 'sectoral'
                                        method of input tax apportionment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to being used for different divisions of the same
                                        entity, this method can
                                        also be used by different entities which are members of the same
                                        tax group – e.g. where
                                        a single type of input tax apportionment method is not
                                        appropriate for all members of
                                        the group.

                                                Firstly, the taxable person must identify the residual input
                                                tax in accordance
                                                with the general rules in Article 55 of the Executive
                                                Regulations as described
                                                in this Guide.

                                            <p>
                                                Secondly, any residual input tax which relates wholly to a
                                                particular sector
                                                (i.e. division or entity) is allocated wholly to that
                                                sector.

                                                is divided between those sectors in accordance with an
                                                appropriate allocation
                                                method (discussed below).
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Finally, each of the sectors will be assigned an own input
                                                tax apportionment
                                                method appropriate for that specific sector (e.g. either the
                                                standard input tax
                                                apportionment method, outputs-based method, transactions
                                                count method or
                                                floorspace method).
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        This assigned method would then be used by the sector to
                                        apportion the residual
                                        input tax relating to that sector.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Where residual input tax of the business relates to multiple
                                        sectors of that business,
                                        it is necessary to allocate the input tax to these individual
                                        sectors. There are two
                                        methods which can be used for such an allocation:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                        </li>

                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p><em><u>Headcount method</u></em></p>
                                    <p>
                                        The headcount method is used when overhead expenses incurred are
                                        in closest
                                        relation to the number of employees, i.e. if the expenses are
                                        linked to
                                        employees. For example, an insurance company may have different
                                        employees solely
                                        working in its (distinct) life and general insurance divisions,
                                        respectively.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The headcount method uses the full-time equivalent (FTE) of
                                        staff (usually
                                        income generating only, not back office) employed or used in
                                        each sector. In
                                        instances where employees work in more than one
                                        department/division/unit, the
                                        staff numbers shall be measured on a FTE basis.
                                    </p>

                                        The outputs method is best used where expenses are linked to
                                        income. The amount
                                        of income in the sector may therefore be reflective of the input
                                        tax on
                                        expenses.

                                    <p>The allocation under this method is done using the following
                                        formula:</p>

                                    <p class='formula' style='text-align: center;'>

                                        This method can be appropriate for a wide-range of entities in both private and
                                        not-for-profit sectors. It may not be appropriate, however, where the business
                                        has a mixture of well-established sectors and sectors in a start-up phase, as
                                        the expectation would be that the start-up divisions would have proportionally
                                        more expenses than income.

                                    such information as the FTA believes is necessary in order to make a
