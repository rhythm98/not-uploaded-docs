                                There are, however, a number of additional VAT rules which are intended to apply
                                specifically to
                                e-commerce arrangements.</p>

                                The remaining part of this Chapter provides an overview of general VAT rules which
                                affect most
                                types of supplies, including supplies of goods and services made in the context of
                                e-commerce.

                            <p>UAE VAT is
                                governed by the Decree-Law and the Executive Regulation.</p>
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that VAT legislation contemplates special rules for cross-border
                                supplies of
                                goods and services between the UAE and &ldquo;Implementing States&rdquo;, which are the
                                GCC States
                                that are
                                implementing a VAT system. At the current time, none of the GCC states are considered to
                                be
                                Implementing States for the purposes of the UAE VAT. As a consequence, this version of
                                the Guide
                                does not cover special rules applicable to supplies with Implementing States.</p>

                            <p>
                                VAT is a transaction-based indirect tax, which is charged and collected at each stage of
                                the
                                supply chain by legal and natural persons (&ldquo;persons&rdquo;) which meet the
                                requirements to be
                                registered for VAT.</p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, persons which are either registered or are required to register for VAT (known as
                                &ldquo;taxable
                                persons&rdquo;) charge VAT to their customers on taxable supplies of goods or services.

                                taxable
                                supply is defined in the VAT legislation as a &ldquo;supply of goods or services for a

                                by
                                submitting a periodic tax return (also known as a &ldquo;VAT return&rdquo;).</p>
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that taxable persons will typically be charged VAT (known as

                                VAT. It is, therefore, necessary to determine when a person is required to be registered
                                for
                                VAT.</p>

                                VAT registration may be either mandatory or voluntary. It should be noted that different

                            <p>
                                For a supply to be within the scope of the UAE VAT regime, the supply needs to take
                                place in the
                                UAE. If a supply takes place outside the UAE, the supply is treated as outside the scope
                                of UAE
                                VAT and therefore UAE VAT will not apply. Furthermore, such an out of scope supply would
                                not
                                count for the purposes of the registration thresholds discussed above.</p>

                                In order to assist businesses in determining where a supply takes place, the VAT
                                legislation
                                provides a number of &ldquo;place of supply&rdquo; rules. These rules are different for
                                goods and
                                services,
                                and may vary depending on a set of specific facts. The specific rules applicable to
                                supplies of
                                goods and services in e-commerce arrangements are discussed in the subsequent parts of

                            <p>
                                Under the default VAT rule for accounting for VAT, a supplier of goods or services is
                                liable to
                                account for VAT on any taxable supply, irrespective of whether the supplier is a UAE
                                resident or
                                not.</p>
                            <p>
                                The &ldquo;reverse charge mechanism&rdquo; is a simplification measure which allows non-
                                resident
                                suppliers
                                to avoid the need to register for VAT in the UAE when they make supplies of goods or
                                services in
                                the UAE to registered persons.</p>
                            <p>
                                Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the non-resident supplier will not charge
                                VAT to the
                                recipient. Instead, the VAT-registered recipient must self-account for the VAT in
                                respect of the
                                goods or services received. This means that the recipient must record the VAT on the
                                acquisition
                                as output tax at the applicable rate in their systems and declare it in their VAT
                                return. This
                                output tax may then be recovered by the recipient as input tax in accordance with the
                                normal input tax recovery rules as applicable
                                to that recipient.</p>

                                The reverse charge mechanism applies in two scenarios. The first scenario applies to a
                                taxable
                                person where that taxable person imports non-exempt goods or services into the
                                UAE <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark8' id='bookmarkback8'>[8]</a>
                                </sup>&ndash;
                                in this context, &ldquo;import&rdquo; means the arrival of goods from abroad into
                                the UAE or the receipt of services from outside the UAE <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark9' id='bookmarkback9'>[9]</a>
                                </sup>. The second
                                scenario where the reverse charge mechanism applies is in situations where the place of
                                supply
                                of goods or services is in the UAE and the following conditions are met: <sup>

                                position as they would have been if they acquired the goods or services from a domestic
                                supplier, thereby ensuring that domestic UAE suppliers are not disadvantaged by VAT not

                                above, the person will, generally, be able to recover the input tax incurred in full. In
                                contrast, where an acquisition is directly linked solely to non-business activities (for
                                example, private use) or exempt supplies (for example, certain supplies of financial
                                services) made by the taxable person, the taxable person will not be able to recover any
                                of the input tax incurred. Finally, where goods or services are used partly in the
                                course of making supplies that allow for the recovery of input tax and partly for making
                                supplies for which VAT is not recoverable, then the taxable person must determine the
                                portion of the input tax that can be recovered.</p>

                                Any recoverable input tax can be recovered through a VAT return. A taxable person is

                            <p>
                                For the purposes of this Guide, a supply of goods in the e-commerce context involves
                                purchasing
                                goods through an electronic platform, such as a website or a marketplace. Once the goods
                                are
                                purchased, they are then delivered to the recipient.</p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the location of the supplier, the recipient, and the goods, the supply may
                                take any
                                of the following basic forms:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                        A supply by a resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being
                                        delivered
                                        from either inside or outside the UAE;</p>
                                </li>

                                        delivered
                                        from either inside or outside the UAE;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A
                                        supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being
                                        delivered
                                        from either inside or outside the UAE; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A
                                        supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient outside the UAE, with goods
                                        being
                                        delivered from either inside or outside the UAE.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                In each of the above scenarios, the supplier has to consider the impact of VAT on the
                                sale of
                                the goods. In addition, where the goods are physically imported into the UAE from
                                outside the
                                UAE, the importer has to consider the impact of the VAT charged on import of the goods.

                                For the purpose of this guide, the UAE refers to the mainland UAE. This guide does not
                                consider
                                supplies of goods to, from or within Designated Zones. Such supplies are discussed
                                separately in

                            <p>
                                The basic place of supply rule for goods is that, if the goods are located in the UAE
                                when
                                supplied, then they are treated as supplied in the UAE. Similarly, if the goods are
                                located
                                outside the UAE when they are supplied, the place of supply is outside the UAE. Where
                                the supply
                                involves the export of goods from the UAE to a place outside the GCC Implementing States
                                (which
                                is currently, any other state outside the UAE), the place of supply is in the
                                UAE. <sup>

                                As such, a supplier has to consider where the goods are, and which of the place of
                                supply rule
                                applies to a specific transaction. Below we consider various scenarios in more detail.

                                        exported from the UAE to outside the Implementing States, the place of supply of

                                        goods will be the UAE.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        It should be noted that goods are considered to be supplied in the UAE where the
                                        customer receives the ownership or the right to dispose of the goods in the UAE.
                                        For
                                        example, where a supplier imports goods into the UAE prior to transferring them

                                        recipient in the UAE, the supply shall be treated as taking place in the UAE.

                                    <p>
                                        Where a taxable supply in the UAE is made by a supplier which is a taxable
                                        person (i.e.
                                        the supplier is registered or required to register for VAT), the supplier has to
                                        consider which VAT rate should be charged on the supply.</p>
                                    <p><em><u>Goods
                                                supplied locally</u></em></p>

                                        The default VAT rate is 5%. This is the rate which applies to most goods which
                                        are sold
                                        within the UAE.</p>

                                        There are, however, a number of goods which may be subject to the 0% VAT rate
                                        when sold
                                        locally. In the e-commerce context, the most likely example of goods which may

                                        It should be noted that the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the
                                        default rule and therefore should only be used where the supplier can ascertain

                                        are satisfied. In order to ensure that the reverse charge mechanism is not
                                        applied incorrectly, the non- resident supplier should seek to collect
                                        information from the recipient regarding the recipient&apos;s UAE residency and
                                        registration status. The supplier should also

                                Where goods are supplied by the supplier outside of the UAE, the place of supply of the
                                goods is
                                also outside the UAE. Thus, if a supply of goods involves the goods being transferred to
                                the
                                recipient outside of the UAE, the place of supply of the goods is outside the UAE, even
                                if the
                                goods are subsequently imported into the UAE. This means that UAE VAT does not apply to
                                the
                                supply of these goods.</p>

                                This should be contrasted with situations where the goods are first imported into the
                                UAE and
                                then supplied to the recipient &ndash; in such situations, the supply of the goods to
                                the
                                recipient is
                                treated as a local supply in the UAE with the place of supply in the UAE.</p>
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that the physical importation of goods into the UAE would typically
                                also

                                        Customs registration number with the FTA prior to importing goods into the UAE

                                        be done at the time of registering for VAT or at a later time). When any goods
                                        are
                                        subsequently imported into the UAE by this importer using the Customs
                                        registration
                                        number which is registered with the FTA, no VAT will be charged at the time of
                                        import
                                        and the goods will be released to the importer as soon as other customs

                                        completed. The applicable import VAT would then be prepopulated as output tax in

                                        Often, the task of importing goods into the UAE and fulfilling all importation
                                        formalities are delegated to a clearing agent. For example, the task of clearing
                                        the
                                        goods through Customs may be undertaken by a specialised clearing agent, a

                                        party local

                                        Where a clearing agent or equivalent business is importing goods on behalf of a

                                        customs

                                        Where any of the above exceptions apply, the movement of goods into the UAE is
                                        not
                                        treated as an import, and therefore not subject to import VAT. If any conditions
                                        for the
                                        VAT suspension are subsequently broken, the goods may be treated as having been
                                        imported
                                        into the UAE and the VAT will become due on the import from the date the goods
                                        were
                                        originally imported.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In order to benefit from the above VAT exception, the importer is required to
                                        provide a
                                        financial guarantee to the FTA for the amount of VAT chargeable in respect of
                                        the goods.
                                        This guarantee will be refunded by the FTA once the goods leave the UAE in
                                        accordance
                                        with the relevant customs suspension conditions. It should be noted that where
                                        an import
                                        is facilitated by a clearing agent who has a TINCO registration, the TINCO agent
                                        can use
                                        its own guarantee with the FTA, and ask the importer for a guarantee or cash
                                        deposit
                                        which will be refunded once the goods leave the UAE.</p>

                                For a supply to fall under the special VAT rules for electronic services, the supply
                                must, therefore, meet two conditions:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        the service in question must be one of the services mentioned in the above list
                                        of
                                        services; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>the
                                        service must be automatically delivered over the internet, an electronic
                                        network, or an
                                        electronic marketplace.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                The first of these requirements means that a service will not be an electronic
                                service
                                where it is not one of the services listed above, even if the service is
                                supplied using
                                the internet or an electronic network. For example, a supply of legal or
                                financial
                                advice, transport services, or hotel accommodation will not constitute an
                                electronic
                                service simply because the parties use the internet to communicate with each
                                other or to
                                facilitate bookings.</p>
                            <p>
                                The second requirement means that an electronic service should be automatically
                                delivered over the internet, an electronic network, or an electronic marketplace
                                with
                                minimal or no human intervention. Thus, although a small degree of human
                                intervention is
                                acceptable to enable or complete a supply, this intervention should not change
                                the
                                nature of the delivery of a service as being essentially automated. For example,
                                where a
                                recipient receives a manually generated email with a download link for the
                                software which he has picked from the supplier&apos;s website, the software can be
                                still considered automatically delivered &ndash; the human intervention of sending an
                                email
                                with a download link is too insignificant to change the nature of the supply.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The above example can be contrasted with a situation where a recipient
                                commissions
                                customised software which has to be developed by the supplier before being put
                                on the
                                supplier&apos;s website to be available to the recipient. In this situation, the
                                human
                                involvement from the supplier in developing the software is critical to the
                                supplier&apos;s
                                ability to make the supply of services. As a consequence, the services cannot be
                                treated
                                as automatically delivered to the recipient.</p>
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that a supply of electronic services may be made through an
                                electronic marketplace rather than directly by the supplier to the recipient.
                                &ldquo;Electronic marketplace&rdquo; means a distribution service which is operated by
                                electronic
                                means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, or distribution
                                platform, and meets both of the following conditions: <sup>

                                the electronic marketplace is not acting in a capacity as an undisclosed agent, then the

                                Supplies of electronic services (as well as of telecommunications services) are subject
                                to a
                                special place of supply rule. Thus, the place of supply of electronic services
                                is: <sup>

                                The reference to the &ldquo;extent&rdquo; in Article 31 indicates that a single supply
                                may be
                                apportioned for the purposes of a place of supply rules, so that it is treated as partly
                                in the UAE and partly outside the UAE. This ability to apportion a supply is, however,
                                limited to situations where a sufficient distinction exists between the different parts
                                of the supply (i.e. services supplied) or consideration (amounts charged for such
                                services)
                                so as it is practical and reasonable to divide them.</p>
                            <p>
                                The actual use and enjoyment of electronic services should be determined on the basis of
                                where the electronic services are consumed by the recipient, regardless of the place of
                                contract or payment. <sup>

                                </sup>Since the legislation does not provide
                                any express rule regarding the indicators which should be used to determine the place of
                                use and enjoyment, this determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, and all of
                                the facts of the supply must be considered.</p>

                                Nevertheless, the following principles may be used as high-level guidance in determining
                                the place of use and enjoyment in various scenarios:</p>
                            <ul>

                                        In the case of an electronic service which is delivered to a physical place, the
                                        place
                                        of use and enjoyment of that service is that physical place. For example, where
                                        electronic services content can be only accessed from a particular physical
                                        location,
                                        that location will be the place of use and enjoyment.</p>

                                        determining the location of the recipient, the supplier should give priority to

                                        will be used and enjoyed. For example, if a KSA resident orders an on-demand

                                        on a computer with an IP address in the UAE, the use and enjoyment of the film

                            <h3>Imposition of VAT</h3>
                            <p>
                                The place of supply of electronic services determines whether or not the services are
                                subject to
                                VAT in the UAE. Where the place of supply is outside the UAE, no UAE VAT would apply. In
                                contrast, where the place of supply is in the UAE, the supply will fall within the UAE
                                VAT net.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The default VAT rate on a taxable supply of services in the UAE is 5%. The supply may,
                                however,
                                be zero-rated if it falls under any of the zero-rating scenarios in Article 45 of the
                                Decree-Law. For example, a supply of an electronic service of distance learning which is
                                automatically delivered over the internet may be zero-rated if it is covered by Article
                                45(13)
                                of the Decree-Law, read with Article 40 of the Executive Regulation.</p>

                            <h3>Accounting for VAT</h3>
                            <p>
                                Similar to supplies of goods discussed in Part 3.3.2 of this Guide, the responsibility
                                for
                                accounting for VAT on any taxable supply of electronic services in the UAE typically
                                lies with
                                the taxable supplier of those electronic services, unless the reverse charge mechanism
                                applies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In respect of cross-border supplies of electronic services into the UAE (i.e. import of
                                services
                                into the UAE from abroad), the reverse charge mechanism applies where the supplier does
                                not have
                                a place of residence in the UAE and the recipient is either registered or required to
                                register
                                for VAT in the UAE. <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark30' id='bookmarkback30'>[30]</a>
                                </sup></p>
                            <p>
                                Where the reverse charge mechanism applies to a supply, the recipient, rather than the
                                non-resident supplier, must account for the VAT to the FTA at the applicable VAT rate.
                                The VAT
                                should be charged on top of the agreed price for the electronic services. <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark31' id='bookmarkback31'>[31]</a>
                                </sup>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the default rule of accounting for
                                VAT, it
                                should only be used where the supplier can ascertain that all of the conditions for the
                                application of the reverse charge are met. If the non-resident supplier cannot ascertain
                                the
                                necessary particulars for the application of the reverse charge mechanism to a
                                particular
                                supply, then the responsibility to account for VAT remains with the supplier.</p>
                            <p>
                                Since the reverse charge mechanism is only applicable when specific conditions are met,
                                taxable
                                supplies from the same non-resident supplier of electronic services may be subject to
                                different
                                VAT accounting treatments &ndash; while a taxable supply made to a UAE taxable person
                                would be
                                subject
                                to the reverse charge mechanism under Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law, the same supply
                                made to a
                                non-taxable person would not be subject to the reverse charge mechanism and would
                                continue being
                                the obligation of the supplier. As such, the supplier may continue being responsible for
                                accounting for VAT on
                                supplies which are not subject to the reverse charge mechanism.</p>
                            <p>
                                For example, if a non-resident supplier of cross-border electronic services makes
                                supplies to
                                both taxable and non-taxable persons, it will be liable to register for VAT and to
                                account for
                                UAE VAT on its supplies to non-taxable persons. However, tax on its supplies to taxable
                                persons
                                is the responsibility of its customers, who shall be responsible to account for VAT
                                under
                                Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law. Note that this treatment is only applicable to
                                cross-border
                                supplies of services, and the rules for goods are different, as explained in 3.3.2 of

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                In the context of e-commerce, supplies of goods and services are often made using
                                electronic
                                platforms, portals, gateway or marketplaces (&ldquo;electronic marketplaces&rdquo;).
                                Such electronic
                                marketplaces may sell goods or services themselves, as well as act as intermediaries
                                between the
                                supplier and the recipient of goods or services.</p>
                            <p>
                                Where an electronic marketplace makes any supplies of goods or services in its capacity
                                as a
                                principal supplier (for example, it buys and then sells goods), then the electronic
                                marketplace
                                is treated as the supplier of those goods or services for VAT purposes. As a
                                consequence, the
                                electronic marketplace would be required to comply with the VAT rules and obligations
                                which are
                                typically applicable to suppliers of those goods or services.</p>
                            <p>
                                Where an electronic marketplace is not acting as a principal supplier of goods or
                                services, it
                                may act as an intermediary which enables a sale of goods and services. For example, an
                                electronic marketplace may be used to advertise products, make bookings, process
                                payments, and
                                arrange deliveries of goods and services.</p>
                            <p>
                                The VAT treatment of supplies using intermediaries will depend on the arrangement
                                between the
                                supplier, the intermediary and the recipient of the supply:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Where the intermediary is acting as a disclosed agent (as defined and explained
                                        in Part
                                        5.2 below) between the supplier and the recipient of the supply, then the supply
                                        is
                                        treated as made directly by the supplier to the recipient.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Where the intermediary is acting as an undisclosed agent (as defined and
                                        explained in
                                        Part 5.2) between the supplier and the recipient of the supply, then there are
                                        two
                                        supplies for VAT purposes &ndash; from the supplier to the intermediary, and
                                        from the
                                        intermediary to the recipient.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The rest of this Chapter discusses VAT rules applicable to supplies of goods or services
                                made
                                through intermediaries in their capacities as agents acting on behalf of a principal.

                            <h3>Types of agency arrangements</h3>
                            <p>
                                An agent is a person who acts on behalf of another person in respect of a specific task.
                                In a
                                commercial transaction, an agent can act on behalf of a supplier of goods or services,
                                or on
                                behalf of a recipient of goods or services, or both. In the context of e-commerce, an
                                agent is
                                typically an intermediary which is authorised by the principal supplier to act on its
                                behalf in
                                finding, and dealing with, customers.</p>
                            <p>
                                From a VAT perspective, a different VAT treatment applies to supplies made through
                                disclosed and
                                undisclosed agents. As a consequence, it is important to be able to determine whether or
                                not an intermediary is acting as a disclosed or an undisclosed agent:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        A disclosed agent is an agent which acts on behalf and in the name of a
                                        principal. In
                                        disclosed agency situations, the recipient of the supply knows that it is
                                        dealing with
                                        an agent of a principal, even if the recipient may not have any direct
                                        communication
                                        with the principal.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>An
                                        undisclosed agent is an agent acting in its own name, where the customer has no
                                        knowledge, and cannot be reasonably expected to have knowledge, that the agent
                                        is acting
                                        on behalf of a principal. It should be noted that this situation is different

                                        situations where no other principal is involved at all and the
                                        &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; is
                                        a
                                        principal itself &ndash; in undisclosed agency situation, the agent is still
                                        acting on
                                        behalf
                                        of a principal.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                In order to determine the existence and the disclosed / undisclosed nature of an agency
                                relationship, the starting point is to analyse contractual arrangements between parties.
                                The
                                contractual arrangement should typically be taken as representative of the true
                                relationship
                                between parties unless it is clearly a sham or is fundamentally inconsistent with the
                                reality of
                                the actual transaction. In interpreting contractual arrangements, it is only necessary
                                to
                                consider information which has been made available to the parties at the time they
                                entered the
                                agreement. For example, the fact that there is an agency agreement between the principal
                                supplier and the agent does not in itself imply that this fact should be known to an
                                unsuspecting recipient of the supply.</p>
                            <p>
                                It should be noted that in some situations, a person may be described as an
                                &ldquo;agent&rdquo;, but
                                will in
                                practice make supplies of goods or services on its own account. For VAT purposes, such
                                labels
                                should be ignored and the person should be treated as a principal in respect of the
                                relevant
                                supplies.</p>

                                The VAT treatment of supplies made through agents differs depending on whether it is a
                                disclosed

                                    <p>
                                        In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Decree-Law, a supply of goods and
                                        services
                                        through an agent acting in the name of and on behalf of a principal, i.e.
                                        through a
                                        disclosed agent, is considered to be a supply by the principal and for his
                                        benefit.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The above means that where an agent, such as an electronic marketplace, is
                                        acting as a
                                        disclosed agent of the principal supplier in respect of a supply of goods or
                                        services,
                                        then the supply of these goods or services is treated as made directly by the
                                        principal
                                        supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a result, the VAT obligations for
                                        the supply
                                        will remain with the principal supplier, and the principal supplier should
                                        account for
                                        this VAT in its tax return if required under the normal VAT rules.</p>

                                        Where an agent is charging an agency fee or commission for its agency services,
                                        these
                                        agency services should be treated as a separate supply of services from the
                                        supply of
                                        the underlying goods or services.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Where the place of supply of such agency services is in the UAE, the services
                                        are
                                        considered a taxable supply. It should be noted that the place of supply for
                                        agency
                                        services provided by agents must be determined independently from the place of
                                        supply of
                                        the underlying goods and services, and therefore can differ from the place of
                                        supply of
                                        such goods or services. For example, where a UAE agent provides agency services
                                        to a UAE
                                        supplier of electronic services which have a place of supply in the USA under
                                        the use
                                        and enjoyment rules, the place of supply of the agency services would still be
                                        in the
                                        UAE.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The default VAT rate for a taxable supply of agency services in the UAE is 5%.
                                        However,
                                        in certain situations, the services may be zero-rated where they are supplied to
                                        a

                                        As discussed in Part 5.3.1, where an undisclosed agent and the principal agree
                                        that the
                                        agent can charge a separate agency fee or commission for the agency services to
                                        the
                                        principal, the agent must consider the VAT treatment of this services separately
                                        from
                                        the VAT treatment of the underlying supply of goods or services.</p>

                                        On the other hand, where the agent is able to embed the fee as a mark-up to the
                                        sale
                                        price of the goods or services, then the VAT treatment of the agency services
                                        should
                                        follow the VAT treatment of the underlying goods or services.</p>

                            <h3>Tax invoice requirements</h3>
                            <p>As a default
                                rule, a VAT-registered supplier of a taxable supply of goods or services is required to
                                issue an original tax
                                invoice and deliver it to the recipient of the supply. <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark34' id='bookmarkback34'>[34]</a>
                                </sup>This condition
                                applies
                                irrespective of whether the goods are sold directly or through an electronic
                                marketplace.</p>
                            <p>As an
                                exception to the default rule, where a VAT-registered agent makes a supply of goods or
                                services on behalf of a
                                principal, the agent may issue a tax invoice in relation to that supply as if that agent
                                had made the
                                supply. <sup>
                                    <a href='#bookmark35' id='bookmarkback35'>[35]</a>
                                </sup>A tax invoice issued by the agent must contain all the usual
                                particulars
                                required under Article 59 of the Executive Regulation, but may include the agent&apos;s,
                                rather than the supplier&apos;s,
                                details &ndash; in which case, the invoice should, however, contain a reference to the
                                principal supplier (including
                                the supplier&apos;s name and TRN) somewhere on the invoice.</p>
                            <p>Only one tax
                                invoice may be issued for any supply of goods or services. Therefore, this option is not
                                available where the
                                principal supplier has already issued a tax invoice. Similarly, where an agent has
                                issued a tax invoice in
                                respect of a supply made by the principal, the agent must ensure that the principal
                                receives a copy of that tax
                                invoice, and the principal should not issue its own tax invoice in respect of the same
                                supply.</p>
                            <p>It is
                                important to note that where the invoice is issued by the agent, the supply is still
                                treated as being made by
                                the principal supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a consequence,
                                the supplier has to account for the relevant VAT and must comply with all the
                                record-keeping requirements in
                                respect of the supply.</p>
                            <p>Finally, it
                                should be noted that where an agent is an undisclosed agent which is treated as making
                                the supply under Article
                                9(2) of the Decree-Law, the undisclosed agent has the responsibility to issue a tax
                                invoice in its own name.</p>
