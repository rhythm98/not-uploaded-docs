                                <h3>2.1.1 What is Insurance?</h3>
                                <p>These are services which are provided by businesses or persons which involve the
                                    following:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>a contract which provides that the insured will become entitled to something on
                                        the
                                        occurrence of some event;</li>
                                    <li>the event must be one which involves some element of uncertainty;</li>
                                    <li>the insured must have an insurable interest in the subject matter of the
                                        contract.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>In practice:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>the insurer makes an offer to the potentially insured party, which the latter
                                        either
                                        accepts or rejects. The parties must be in agreement as to the intention of the
                                        contract of insurance;</li>
                                    <li>there must be an intention to enter into a legal relationship under which one
                                        party
                                        has an obligation to provide insurance; and</li>
                                    <li>there must be some payment, right or benefit offered by the potentially insured
                                        party to the contract of insurance. The premium forms the insured's
                                        (policyholder's)
                                        consideration in return for the insurer's promise to pay according to the terms
                                        of
                                        the policy.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The risks covered by a contract of insurance can be very wide and can include: fire,
                                    accident, motor vehicles, loss of profits, general indemnity, health, life and
                                    endowment
                                    business.</p>

                                <p>Insurance and services related to the provision of insurance will be undertaken by
                                    insurers, insurance agents, brokers and underwriters.</p>

                                <p>For insurers and reinsurers, income will mainly be derived from premiums, though
                                    there
                                    may also be significant income from investments.</p>

                                <p>Insurance intermediaries (often known as insurance agents and brokers) will largely
                                    receive income in the form of commission or fees and may also derive income from the
                                    short-term investment of funds.</p>

                                <p>Historically, transactions in the sector were complex to analyse and presented
                                    difficulties, both in identifying the supply chains and the values of the various
                                    supplies being made.</p>

                                <p>However, more recently, insurance and its related services have become more easily
                                    identifiable, transparent and measurable than in the past due to technological
                                    advancements and global developments in the manner in which transactions are
                                    conducted.
                                </p>

                                <p>Accordingly, the starting point for the VAT treatment of insurance and related
                                    services
                                    supplied in the UAE is that VAT should be charged where it is practicable to do so.
                                </p>

                                <p>Only two specific types of insurance are defined by way of exception in the Federal
                                    Decree-Law<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> and Executive
                                    Regulations<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>, namely:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>life insurance and associated reinsurance (exempt)<sup><a href="#footnote3"
                                                id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>; and</li>
                                    <li>insurance relating to the international transport of goods and passengers
                                        (zero-rated)<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>For completeness, it should be noted that insurance is different from warranties.
                                    Unlike
                                    insurance, where obligations of an insurer are usually triggered by a certain event,
                                    a
                                    "warranty" is typically a written guaranty that a good is free from defects and that
                                    the
                                    manufacturer will replace or repair any defective parts or parts which fail in the
                                    course of the normal operation of the good due to standard wear and tear. It should
                                    be
                                    noted that there are no specific VAT rules in the legislation for warranties, and
                                    therefore they should generally be treated as taxable.</p>

                                    protect itself from risks. As such, it is not different from any other insurance –

                            <p>Most business transactions involve supplies of good or services. A taxable supply is one
                                where there is:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>a supply of goods or services;</li>
                                <li>for consideration;</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Where a taxable supply is made by a taxable person (i.e. by a person registered, or
                                obliged
                                to be registered, for VAT), that supply is subject to VAT.</p>

                            <p>Supplies may be subject to VAT at either the standard rate or zero-rate of VAT.</p>

                                <h3>3.1.1. Standard rate</h3>
                                <p>In general terms, where VAT is charged at the standard rate, businesses that are
                                    registered for VAT are able to recover the VAT they are charged by their suppliers
                                    on
                                    goods and services, subject to certain conditions. VAT which is incurred on
                                    purchases is
                                    known as 'input tax'.</p>

                                    treated
                                    as taxable supplies in all respects, including the right of the person making the

                            <h3>3.2. What is an exempt supply?</h3>
                            <p>Similar to zero-rated supplies, no VAT is charged in respect of exempt supplies. However,
                                since those supplies are not 'taxable supplies', the supplier cannot recover any of the
                                VAT
                                on expenses (input tax) directly incurred in making exempt supplies.</p>

                            <p>In addition, businesses which make supplies with a mixture of differing VAT liabilities
                                will
                                need to use a method of apportionment in respect of VAT incurred on general costs (i.e.
                                input tax which is non-attributable to either taxable or exempt supplies).</p>

                            <p>Incurred VAT therefore may represent a large irrecoverable cost to businesses involved in
                                making supplies which are wholly or partly exempt from VAT, such as those operating in
                                the
                                financial services and insurance sectors.</p>

                            <p>As codified in the Law and in conformity with its obligations under the Common VAT
                                Agreement
                                of the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the UAE has taken a narrow approach to
                                the
                                use of VAT exemption.</p>

                            <p>Thus, the majority of transactions taking place in the UAE are subject to tax with only a
                                very limited number of exceptions to this general rule. These exceptions will include
                                the
                                provision or transfer of ownership of a life insurance contract or the provision of re-
                                insurance in respect of any such contract<sup><a href="#footnote10"
                                        id="ref10">[10]</a></sup>, subject to certain conditions in connection with
                                fees<sup><a href="#footnote11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup> and similar charges, as

                            <p>A business may make multiple supplies where it charges a single inclusive price for a
                                number
                                of separate supplies of goods or services. This is different from a single supply of a
                                mixture of goods or services (known as a "single composite supply"), to which a single
                                rate
                                of tax applies.</p>

                            <p>These scenarios can apply to insurance products which may be packaged or 'bundled'
                                together
                                where they would ordinarily be treated as separate services or in the opposite
                                situation,
                                where a single composite supply could be unbundled or artificially split into separate
                                components.</p>

                                    in respect of each of these supplies.</p>

                                    method of valuing each supply which is fair and reasonable. This could include using
                                    the
                                    cost of each element of the supply as a proxy for assigning a value to each

                                    the supply. The value of each supply must be disclosed to the customer.</p>

                                    <p>For example, an insurer provides car insurance and life insurance. It charges two

                                <h3>3.3.2. Single composite supplies</h3>
                                <p>A single composite supply is one, single indivisible supply of a mixture of goods
                                    and/or
                                    services. The supply is treated as a single supply and is subject to VAT at one rate
                                    which is applied to the value of the supply as a whole. You must not use
                                    apportionment
                                    where you make a single composite supply.</p>

                                <p>There will be a single composite supply where one or more elements of the supply
                                    comprise
                                    the principal component, with other elements being ancillary – i.e. not an aim in
                                    itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal component. The contractual
                                    nature
                                    and wider circumstances of such supplies will be taken into account.</p>

                                <p>In addition, there will be a single composite supply where there is a supply which
                                    has
                                    two or more elements which are so closely linked that they form a single supply and
                                    which it would be artificial or impossible to split.</p>

                                <p>Charging a single price is not determinative, but may suggest that there is a single
                                    composite supply. However, where there are indications that the recipient intended
                                    to
                                    buy two distinct services, with different VAT liabilities, this could mean that the
                                    single price should be apportioned.</p>

                                <p>A single composite supply will only typically exist where:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>the price of the different components of the supply is <strong>not</strong>
                                        separately identified or charged by the supplier; and</li>
                                    <li>all the components of the supply are supplied by a single supplier.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <div class="example">
                                    <p>For example, an insurer may offer life insurance which includes an element of

                                        insurance to make the product more attractive. The prices are not separately
                                        identified. The premium would be exempt because the principal component is the

                                    <p>Where services are received by a UAE VAT-registered business from a person

                                        supplies would be standard-rated supplies were they are made in the UAE.</p>

                                        usual rules of recovery, including those of Input Tax Apportionment (see section

                                    <p>For example, where a UAE based insurance company cedes its risks to a reinsurer

                                        reinsurance it is exempt). At the same time, the insurance company will also be
                                        entitled to recover input tax for such services, subject to the normal rules for

                                    <h3>4.2.2. Example</h3>
                                    <p>For example, family takaful provides a combination of long term savings and
                                        protection for participants and their dependants typically arising from death,
                                        disability or survival.</p>

                                    <p>Generally, supplies of family takaful or family retakaful products would be
                                        exempt
                                        from VAT as their non-Islamic equivalents of life insurance or reinsurance would
                                        be.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>In non-Islamic Finance, if the savings element relates to investment in a fund
                                        and
                                        the insurance provider were to make a separate charge for managing this fund,
                                        then
                                        the same treatment would apply to the Islamic fee, i.e. it would be taxable.</p>

                                    <p>It is recognised, however, that certain aspects of Islamic insurance may preclude
                                        direct equivalence in VAT treatment being applied. In such cases, the underlying
                                        purpose, features and circumstances of the product concerned must be taken into
                                        account when determining the appropriate VAT treatment.</p>

                                    <p>Any significant difference in the overall liability between an Islamic insurance
                                        product and any non-Islamic counterpart arising as a consequence of differential
                                        treatment being applied will be addressed on a product by product basis.</p>

                                    <p>Providers of particularly complex or non-standard Islamic insurance products
                                        should
                                        analyse these carefully and consider seeking advice on the VAT liability of such

                                    <h3>4.3.1. Contracts of insurance</h3>
                                    <p>Where a contract is entered into prior to the effective date of the VAT law which
                                        concerns a supply made wholly or partly after the effective date of the VAT Law,
                                        VAT
                                        will be due on the supply taking place after the effective date of the VAT Law.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>If the contract does not mention VAT, the value of the supply stated in the

                                        shall be treated as inclusive of VAT.</p>

                                    <p>For VAT purposes, insurance contracts are treated as continuous supplies of

                                        with premiums often payable in instalments.</p>

                                    <p>Therefore, as a result of the VAT Law on transitional provisions, part of the

                                    <h3>4.4.1. Health insurance</h3>
                                    <p>The provision of health insurance will be liable to VAT at the standard rate.
                                        Where
                                        this is provided by an employer to an employee as a benefit which is part of a
                                        contract of employment, the employer will be able to recover the input tax on
                                        such
                                        products, subject to the usual rules of VAT recovery.</p>

                                    <p>Where an employer provides health insurance to the family of the employee, input
                                        tax
                                        will only be recoverable if there is a legal obligation to provide the insurance

                                        the family members.</p>

                                    <p>The reason for this is that Article 53 of the Executive Regulations dealing with
                                        blocked input tax envisages that costs incurred for the personal benefit of
                                        employees (which health insurance would be), will only be recoverable where:</p>

                                            <p>It is a legal obligation to provide those services or goods to those

                                            <p>It is a contractual obligation or documented policy to provide those
                                                services

                                            <p>Where the provision of goods or services is a deemed supply under the

                                    <p>The important part of the above is under 2, where family health insurance is a
                                        contractual obligation, then it must also be required <u><b>in order that the
                                                employee may perform their role</b></u>. It is not the case that an
                                        employee
                                        requires their family member to have health insurance in order that the employee
                                        may

                                        families under 2 above should not be recoverable.</p>

                                        provided with health insurance, this would be dealt with under 1 above and the

                                    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, a supply of insurance in respect of real estate will
                                        not
                                        be considered a "service related to real estate" for the purposes of the place
                                        of
                                        supply rule in Article 30(7) of the VAT Law. Therefore, the place of supply of
                                        the
                                        insurance relating to real estate has to be determined on the basis of the
                                        general
                                        place of supply rules, i.e. by reference to the Place of Residence of the
                                        supplier<sup><a href="#footnote16" id="ref16">[16]</a></sup>.</p>

                                    <p>If the insurance is exported, i.e. where the recipient of the Real Estate
                                        insurance
                                        is not located in the UAE or other GCC Implementing States, it will be

                                    <p>Please note that where the provision of insurance is included within the service
                                        charge for real estate, then this is likely to be related to the real estate for
                                        place of supply purposes under Article 21 of the Executive Regulations. In such
                                        cases, the place of supply will be determined not by reference to the Place of
                                        Residence of the supplier, but by reference to the location of the real estate
                                        in
                                        question.</p>

                                    <p>For this to apply, the insurance must be part of a single composite supply; must
                                        not
                                        be the principal component of that supply, and</p>

                                                the insured on the insurer's behalf. This is not a supply for VAT

                                    <p>The following principles should be applied in respect of determining which party

                                    <p>Input tax recovery in respect of an expense must, in all cases, either reflect

                                        to different supplies, each of which carries a different right to recovery,
                                        there is
                                        an inherent risk that the means by which that apportionment is carried out and

                                    <p>In that regard, all businesses must take care when making use of an input tax
                                        apportionment method that it is 'fair and reasonable' in their particular
                                        circumstances. Where it is not, the business should take steps to ensure that an
                                        alternative method is identified and adopted. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA)
                                        will

                                        apply to the FTA to make use of a special input tax apportionment method where

                                        has first established that the standard input tax apportionment method would not
                                        render a result which is fair and reasonable in the context of their particular
