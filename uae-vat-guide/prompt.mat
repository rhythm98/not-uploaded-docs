                                    <p>VAT was introduced with effect from 1 January 2018 in the UAE. As a general
                                        consumption tax on
                                        the supply of goods and services, its effects must be understood by providers of
                                        financial services
                                        in the UAE, in two contexts:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Its application to the activities of all financial services providers.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>The approach financial services providers in the UAE should take to
                                                determine
                                                the amount of

                                                taxable and
                                                exempt financial services.</p>
