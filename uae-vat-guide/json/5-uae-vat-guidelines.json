As a general consumption tax on the supply of goods and services, it applies to supplies which take place within the territorial area of the UAE.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.2'><h3>Purpose of this document</h3><p>This document contains guidance about the VAT treatment of supplies of goods and services through electronic means, such as over the internet or a similar electronic network.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on how VAT affects businesses which operate within the e-commerce sector.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.3'><h3>Who should read this document?</h3><p>This document should be read by businesses involved in the e-commerce sector.</p><p>It is intended to be read in conjunction with other relevant guidance published by the Federal Tax Authority (&ldquo;FTA&rdquo;).</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.4'><h3>Status of the document</h3><p>In this guide, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as &ldquo;Decree-Law&rdquo; and Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax and its amendments is referred to as &ldquo;Executive Regulation&rdquo;. This guidance is not legally binding on the FTA but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the VAT legislation as it applies to e-commerce.</p><p>This guide is issued in accordance with Article 73 of the Executive Regulation and provides general guidance concerning the application of the Decree-Law and Executive Regulation in respect of e-commerce in the United Arab Emirates. This guide does not deal with all the legal details associated with VAT and is not intended for legal reference. For details in respect of the general operation of VAT, refer to the <i>Taxable Person Guide &ndash; Value Added Tax </i><a href='http://www.tax.gov.ae/' target='_blank'>which is available on the FTA website (</a>www.tax.gov.ae).</p></article></section></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection2'><h3>Overview: e-Commerce and VAT</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection2.1'><h3>What is e-commerce?</h3><p>In traditional commerce, goods and services are usually supplied from a physical location, such as a shop or office, with the supplier and the recipient usually present in the same location.</p><p>E-commerce (also known as &ldquo;electronic commerce&rdquo; or sometimes loosely referred to as the &ldquo;digital economy&rdquo;) generally refers to supplies of goods and services over the Internet or a similar electronic network, with goods and services being sourced or supplied by electronic means, such as through a computer, phone website or electronic applications.</p><p>This Guide discusses the following types of transactions:</p><ul><li><p>goods purchased through an electronic platform; and</p></li><li><p>services supplied by electronic means.</p></li></ul><p>It should be noted that many of the general VAT rules also apply to e-commerce transactions. There are, however, a number of additional VAT rules which are intended to apply specifically to e-commerce arrangements.</p><p>The remaining part of this Chapter provides an overview of general VAT rules which affect most types of supplies, including supplies of goods and services made in the context of e-commerce.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.2'><h3>Legislative background</h3><p>UAE VAT is governed by the Decree-Law and the Executive Regulation.</p><p>It should be noted that VAT legislation contemplates special rules for cross-border supplies of goods and services between the UAE and &ldquo;Implementing States&rdquo;, which are the GCC States that are implementing a VAT system. At the current time, none of the GCC states are considered to be Implementing States for the purposes of the UAE VAT. As a consequence, this version of the Guide does not cover special rules applicable to supplies with Implementing States.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.3'><h3>What is VAT?</h3><p>VAT is a transaction-based indirect tax, which is charged and collected at each stage of the supply chain by legal and natural persons (&ldquo;persons&rdquo;) which meet the requirements to be registered for VAT.</p><p>Thus, persons which are either registered or are required to register for VAT (known as &ldquo;taxable persons&rdquo;) charge VAT to their customers on taxable supplies of goods or services. A taxable supply is defined in the VAT legislation as a &ldquo;supply of goods or services for a consideration by a person conducting business in the UAE, and does not include an exempt supply&rdquo;. <sup><a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a> </sup>As a consequence, for a supply to be a taxable supply, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li><p>there needs to be a supply of goods or services;</p></li><li><p>the supply has to be for consideration;</p></li><li><p>the supply has to be made by a person who is conducting business in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>the supply should not be an exempt supply.</p></li></ul><p>Taxable supplies may either be subject to the standard rate of 5% <sup><a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a> </sup>or zero rate <sup><a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a> </sup>(i.e. 0%). A supply cannot be a taxable supply if it is an exempt supply. Where a supply is neither a taxable supply nor an exempt supply, it will be outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p><p>VAT which taxable persons charge to their customers is known as &ldquo;output tax&rdquo;. On a periodic basis, taxable persons are required to account for output tax to the FTA. This is done by submitting a periodic tax return (also known as a &ldquo;VAT return&rdquo;).</p><p>It should be noted that taxable persons will typically be charged VAT (known as &ldquo;input tax&rdquo;) by their suppliers when they acquire goods and services. Taxable persons are generally able to recover input tax, subject to certain conditions. Where the conditions allowing recovery of input tax are met, taxable persons are able to deduct this input tax from the value of output tax declared in the same VAT return.</p><p>The difference between the output tax and input tax reported by a taxable person in their VAT returns is either the net VAT payable to the FTA (if the output tax exceeds the input tax) or net VAT recoverable from the FTA (if the input tax exceeds the output tax) for that specific tax return period.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.4'><h3>VAT registration requirements</h3><p>As mentioned above, a person is only required to account for VAT in the UAE, if it is a taxable person &ndash; that is, if the person is either registered for VAT or is obligated to register for VAT. It is, therefore, necessary to determine when a person is required to be registered for VAT.</p><p>VAT registration may be either mandatory or voluntary. It should be noted that different registration requirements and conditions may apply to both mandatory and voluntary registrations depending on whether a person has a place of residence in the UAE. As a consequence, it is important for a person to know whether or not it is resident in the UAE when considering which registration rules apply to it.</p><p>A person would have a place of residence in the UAE for the purposes of VAT registration if the person has a place of establishment or fixed establishment in the UAE. The terms are defined in the Decree-Law: <sup><a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;Place of Establishment&rdquo; is the place where a business is legally established in a country pursuant to the decision of its establishment, in which significant management decisions are taken or central management functions are conducted.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Fixed Establishment&rdquo; is any fixed place of business, other than the Place of Establishment, in which the person conducts his business regularly or permanently and where sufficient human and technology resources exist to enable the person to supply or acquire goods or services, including the person&apos;s branches.</p></li></ul><p>Further details regarding requirements for mandatory and voluntary registrations are provided below.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection2.4.1'><h3>Mandatory registration</h3><p>A person resident in the UAE is required to register for VAT if any of the following apply: <sup><a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the total value of their taxable supplies made within the UAE and imports into the UAE exceeded AED 375,000 over the previous 12-month period; or</p></li><li><p>the person anticipates that the total value of their taxable supplies made within the UAE and imports into the UAE will exceed AED 375,000 in the next 30 days.</p></li></ul><p>The main categories of supplies and imports that need to be taken into account for the purposes of the mandatory registration threshold, and the voluntary registration threshold (discussed in Part 2.4.2 below), are: <sup><a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>Supplies of goods or services made in the UAE in the course of business.</p></li><li><p>Any goods or services that the person has imported into the UAE that would have been subject to VAT had they been supplied in the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>The person should not include in this calculation the value of any supplies which are either exempt from VAT or are outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p><p>In contrast, if the person is not resident in the UAE, the person is required to register for VAT if it makes any taxable supplies in the UAE, unless there is another person in the UAE who is responsible for accounting for VAT on such activities. As such, for non-resident suppliers, the registration threshold is, in effect, nil.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.4.2'><h3>Voluntary registration</h3><p>Voluntary registration is an option available to businesses which do not have a turnover in excess of the mandatory registration threshold but would still like to be registered for VAT. A person can voluntarily register for VAT if: <sup><a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>at the end of any month, the total value of the person&apos;s taxable supplies and imports, or their expenses which were subject to VAT, in the previous 12 months exceeded AED 187,500; or</p></li><li><p>the total value of the person&apos;s taxable supplies and imports, or their expenses which are subject to VAT, is expected to exceed AED 187,500 in the next 30 days.</p></li></ul><p>It should be noted that a non-resident person is not allowed to voluntarily register on the basis of its &ldquo;taxable expenses&rdquo;.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.5'><h3>Place of supply</h3><p>For a supply to be within the scope of the UAE VAT regime, the supply needs to take place in the UAE. If a supply takes place outside the UAE, the supply is treated as outside the scope of UAE VAT and therefore UAE VAT will not apply. Furthermore, such an out of scope supply would not count for the purposes of the registration thresholds discussed above.</p><p>In order to assist businesses in determining where a supply takes place, the VAT legislation provides a number of &ldquo;place of supply&rdquo; rules. These rules are different for goods and services, and may vary depending on a set of specific facts. The specific rules applicable to supplies of goods and services in e-commerce arrangements are discussed in the subsequent parts of this Guide.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.6'><h3>Reverse charge mechanism</h3><p>Under the default VAT rule for accounting for VAT, a supplier of goods or services is liable to account for VAT on any taxable supply, irrespective of whether the supplier is a UAE resident or not.</p><p>The &ldquo;reverse charge mechanism&rdquo; is a simplification measure which allows non- resident suppliers to avoid the need to register for VAT in the UAE when they make supplies of goods or services in the UAE to registered persons.</p><p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the non-resident supplier will not charge VAT to the recipient. Instead, the VAT-registered recipient must self-account for the VAT in respect of the goods or services received. This means that the recipient must record the VAT on the acquisition as output tax at the applicable rate in their systems and declare it in their VAT return. This output tax may then be recovered by the recipient as input tax in accordance with the normal input tax recovery rules as applicable to that recipient.</p><p>The reverse charge mechanism applies in two scenarios. The first scenario applies to a taxable person where that taxable person imports non-exempt goods or services into the UAE <sup><a href='#bookmark8' id='bookmarkback8'>[8]</a> </sup>&ndash; in this context, &ldquo;import&rdquo; means the arrival of goods from abroad into the UAE or the receipt of services from outside the UAE <sup><a href='#bookmark9' id='bookmarkback9'>[9]</a> </sup>. The second scenario where the reverse charge mechanism applies is in situations where the place of supply of goods or services is in the UAE and the following conditions are met: <sup><a href='#bookmark10' id='bookmarkback10'>[10]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the supply is a taxable supply;</p></li><li><p>the supplier&apos;s place of residence is outside the UAE;</p></li><li><p>the supplier does not charge VAT on that supply (i.e. the supplier is not already registered for VAT in the UAE);</p></li><li><p>the recipient&apos;s place of residence is in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>the recipient is registered or required to register for VAT in the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>The purpose of the reverse charge mechanism is to reduce compliance and the administrative burden of collecting VAT from non-resident suppliers. It also puts the recipient in the same position as they would have been if they acquired the goods or services from a domestic supplier, thereby ensuring that domestic UAE suppliers are not disadvantaged by VAT not being collected from purchases from abroad.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.7'><h3>Input tax recovery</h3><p>If the recipient of the supply is a taxable person and is registered for VAT then they may be able to recover the amount of VAT incurred if the necessary conditions, discussed below, are met. Recipients who are not taxable persons are not typically able to recover any VAT on their acquisitions, unless one of the special refund schemes applies.</p><p>The ability to recover VAT by a taxable person is subject to certain conditions. The recovery of input tax will be permitted where acquired goods and services are used, or intended to be used, in making any of the following: <sup><a href='#bookmark11' id='bookmarkback11'>[11]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>taxable supplies;</p></li><li><p>supplies that are made outside the UAE which would have been considered taxable had they been made in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>supplies of financial services which would have been treated as exempt if made in the UAE, but which are provided to a person who is outside the UAE and are treated as taking place outside the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>Where any acquisition by a taxable person relates solely to the supplies indicated above, the person will, generally, be able to recover the input tax incurred in full. In contrast, where an acquisition is directly linked solely to non-business activities (for example, private use) or exempt supplies (for example, certain supplies of financial services) made by the taxable person, the taxable person will not be able to recover any of the input tax incurred. Finally, where goods or services are used partly in the course of making supplies that allow for the recovery of input tax and partly for making supplies for which VAT is not recoverable, then the taxable person must determine the portion of the input tax that can be recovered.</p><p>Any recoverable input tax can be recovered through a VAT return. A taxable person is able to recover input tax in the first tax period in which both of the following conditions are met: <sup><a href='#bookmark12' id='bookmarkback12'>[12]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the taxable person has received and retained a tax invoice or other documentation evidencing the supply or import; and</p></li><li><p>the amount of VAT in question has been paid in whole or in part. It should be noted that the condition will also be met if the person intends to make the payment within six months of the due date of payment.</p></li></ul><p>If the taxable person has not recovered input tax in the tax period in which the conditions have been met, the person will be able to recover this input tax in the following tax period. <sup><a href='#bookmark13' id='bookmarkback13'>[13]</a></sup></p><p>It should be noted that, where a taxable person accounts for VAT in respect of any acquired goods or services under the reverse charge mechanism in its VAT return, that VAT is still the person&apos;s input tax. As a consequence, the taxable person may consider whether it can recover this input tax under the normal input tax recovery rules discussed above, and can recover it in the appropriate VAT return, if appropriate.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection3'><h3>E-commerce: Supplies of Goods</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection3.1'><h3>Introduction</h3><p>For the purposes of this Guide, a supply of goods in the e-commerce context involves purchasing goods through an electronic platform, such as a website or a marketplace. Once the goods are purchased, they are then delivered to the recipient.</p><p>Depending on the location of the supplier, the recipient, and the goods, the supply may take any of the following basic forms:</p><ul><li><p>A supply by a resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being delivered from either inside or outside the UAE;</p></li><li><p>A supply by a resident supplier to a recipient outside the UAE, with goods being delivered from either inside or outside the UAE;</p></li><li><p>A supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient in the UAE, with goods being delivered from either inside or outside the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>A supply by a non-resident supplier to a recipient outside the UAE, with goods being delivered from either inside or outside the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>In each of the above scenarios, the supplier has to consider the impact of VAT on the sale of the goods. In addition, where the goods are physically imported into the UAE from outside the UAE, the importer has to consider the impact of the VAT charged on import of the goods.</p><p>Below we discuss the VAT treatment of sales of goods in more detail.</p><p>For the purpose of this guide, the UAE refers to the mainland UAE. This guide does not consider supplies of goods to, from or within Designated Zones. Such supplies are discussed separately in the Designated Zones VAT Guide | VATGDZ1.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.2'><h3>Place of supply and date of supply of goods</h3><p>The basic place of supply rule for goods is that, if the goods are located in the UAE when supplied, then they are treated as supplied in the UAE. Similarly, if the goods are located outside the UAE when they are supplied, the place of supply is outside the UAE. Where the supply involves the export of goods from the UAE to a place outside the GCC Implementing States (which is currently, any other state outside the UAE), the place of supply is in the UAE. <sup><a href='#bookmark14' id='bookmarkback14'>[14]</a></sup></p><p>As such, a supplier has to consider where the goods are, and which of the place of supply rule applies to a specific transaction. Below we consider various scenarios in more detail.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.3'><h3>Sales of goods from the UAE</h3><p>This part discusses e-commerce arrangements where the sold goods are delivered from the UAE.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection3.3.1'><h3>Imposition of VAT</h3><p>As mentioned in Part 3.2, where the goods are supplied wholly within the UAE or are exported from the UAE to outside the Implementing States, the place of supply of these goods will be the UAE.</p><p>It should be noted that goods are considered to be supplied in the UAE where the customer receives the ownership or the right to dispose of the goods in the UAE. For example, where a supplier imports goods into the UAE prior to transferring them to the recipient in the UAE, the supply shall be treated as taking place in the UAE.</p><p>Where a taxable supply in the UAE is made by a supplier which is a taxable person (i.e. the supplier is registered or required to register for VAT), the supplier has to consider which VAT rate should be charged on the supply.</p><p><em><u>Goods supplied locally</u></em></p><p>The default VAT rate is 5%. This is the rate which applies to most goods which are sold within the UAE.</p><p>There are, however, a number of goods which may be subject to the 0% VAT rate when sold locally. In the e-commerce context, the most likely example of goods which may be zero-rated when sold locally are qualifying pharmaceutical products and medical equipment. <sup><a href='#bookmark15' id='bookmarkback15'>[15]</a></sup></p><p><em><u>Exported goods</u></em></p><p>Where goods are exported from the UAE, the supply may be eligible to be zero-rated as an export in accordance with Article 30 of the Executive Regulation. The conditions for zero-rating vary depending on which party is contractually responsible for arranging the dispatch of goods:</p><ol><li><p>Where the supplier is responsible for arranging transport of sold goods from the UAE or appoints an agent to do so on its behalf (this is known as a &ldquo;direct export&rdquo;), the supply may be zero-rated if the following conditions are met:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The goods are physically exported to a place outside the Implementing States (currently, it is any country outside the UAE) or are put into a customs suspension regime in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law within 90 days of the date of the supply.</p></li><li><p>Official and commercial evidence of export or customs suspension is retained by the exporter.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Where the &ldquo;overseas customer&rdquo; <sup><a href='#bookmark16' id='bookmarkback16'>[16]</a> </sup>is responsible for arranging the collection of the goods from the supplier in the UAE and then exporting the goods or has appointed an agent to do so on his behalf (this is known as &ldquo;indirect export&rdquo;), the supply may be zero-rated if the following conditions are met:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The goods are physically exported to a place outside the Implementing States (currently, it is any country outside the UAE) or are put into a customs suspension regime in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law within 90 days of the date of the supply under an arrangement agreed by the supplier and the overseas customer at or before the date of supply.</p></li><li><p>The overseas customer obtains official and commercial evidence of export or customs suspension in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law, and provides the supplier with a copy of this.</p></li><li><p>The goods are not used or altered in the time between supply and export or customs suspension, except to the extent necessary to prepare the goods for export or customs suspension.</p></li><li><p>The goods do not leave the UAE in the possession of a passenger or crew member of an aircraft or ship.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>It should be noted that one of the common conditions for zero-rating of exports is that the supplier (in the case of a direct export) or the recipient (in the case of an indirect export) must obtain official <b>and </b>commercial evidence of export.</p><p>&ldquo;Official evidence&rdquo; means export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department in respect of goods leaving the UAE &ndash; in most Emirates, this would require the exporter to retain a certificate issued by the relevant Customs Department confirming exit of goods from the UAE (for example, an exit certificate or a similar document evidencing the export).</p><p>On the other hand, &ldquo;commercial evidence&rdquo; refers to a document issued by commercial parties which provides evidence of the transportation of the goods to outside the UAE. Acceptable commercial evidence includes airway bills, bills of lading, consignment notes, and certificate of shipments.</p><p>The purpose of the requirements to obtain official and commercial evidence of export is to ensure that there is sufficient proof that the transaction has taken place and the goods have actually left the UAE. As such, the official and commercial evidence of export must identify the following:</p><ul><li><p>the supplier;</p></li><li><p>the consignor;</p></li><li><p>the goods;</p></li><li><p>the value of the goods;</p></li><li><p>the export destination; and</p></li><li><p>the mode of transport and route of the export movement.</p></li></ul><p>Where the above conditions for zero-rating are not met, or if the goods in question are not exported from the UAE or put into a customs suspension regime within the required period of 90 days, the supplier should account for VAT on the supply at the default rate of 5%.</p><p>If an exporter is of the view that it is impossible to obtain the evidence prescribed under Article 30 of the Executive Regulation, then they may apply for an exception from the FTA. Please refer to VAT Administrative Exceptions Guide | VATGEX1.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.3.2'><h3>Accounting for VAT</h3><p>Typically, the responsibility for accounting for VAT on any supply of goods in the UAE lies with the taxable supplier of goods.</p><p>As discussed in Part 2.6, there may be situations when the obligation to account for VAT passes to the recipient of the goods under the &ldquo;reverse charge mechanism&rdquo;. With respect to a taxable supply of goods that are already in the UAE, the reverse charge mechanism applies where: <sup><a href='#bookmark17' id='bookmarkback17'>[17]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the supplier does not have a place of residence in the UAE;</p></li><li><p>the supplier does not charge VAT on that supply, for example, where the supplier is not already registered for VAT in the UAE, and</p></li><li><p>the recipient is a taxable person with a place of residence in the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the recipient must account for VAT to the FTA at the VAT rate applicable to the acquired goods. This VAT should be charged on the top of the agreed price for the goods (i.e. the price is treated as VAT exclusive). <sup><a href='#bookmark18' id='bookmarkback18'>[18]</a></sup></p><p>It should be noted that the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the default rule and therefore should only be used where the supplier can ascertain that all of the conditions for the application of the reverse charge mechanism are satisfied. In order to ensure that the reverse charge mechanism is not applied incorrectly, the non- resident supplier should seek to collect information from the recipient regarding the recipient&apos;s UAE residency and registration status. The supplier should also retain this information for its records and in order to be able to substantiate the application of the reverse charge mechanism in case of a tax audit. If the non-resident supplier cannot ascertain all of the details necessary for the application of the reverse charge mechanism to a supply, such as that the recipient is registered for VAT, then the supplier should register for VAT in the UAE and account for VAT to the FTA itself.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.4'><h3>Sales of goods from outside the UAE</h3><p>Where goods are supplied by the supplier outside of the UAE, the place of supply of the goods is also outside the UAE. Thus, if a supply of goods involves the goods being transferred to the recipient outside of the UAE, the place of supply of the goods is outside the UAE, even if the goods are subsequently imported into the UAE. This means that UAE VAT does not apply to the supply of these goods.</p><p>This should be contrasted with situations where the goods are first imported into the UAE and then supplied to the recipient &ndash; in such situations, the supply of the goods to the recipient is treated as a local supply in the UAE with the place of supply in the UAE.</p><p>It should be noted that the physical importation of goods into the UAE would typically also trigger the obligation on the importer (either the supplier or the recipient) to account for import VAT. This is discussed in more detail in the next part of this Guide.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.5'><h3>VAT on import of goods into the UAE</h3><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection3.5.1'><h3>Imposition and accounting for import VAT</h3><p>Where goods are imported into the UAE from overseas, the goods will be subject to import VAT at 5%, unless the goods would be either zero-rated or exempt if supplied in the UAE.</p><p>Import VAT is imposed on the customs value as calculated pursuant to Customs legislation, including the value of insurance, freight and any customs fees and excise tax paid on the import of the goods. Where the determination of such customs value is not possible, then the value can be determined based on the alternate valuation rules stated in the applicable Customs legislation. <sup><a href='#bookmark19' id='bookmarkback19'>[19]</a></sup></p><p>The obligation to account for import VAT is on the &ldquo;importer&rdquo;, being the person whose name is listed as the importer of the relevant goods for customs clearance purposes. The mechanism for accounting for VAT on imported goods depends on the VAT registration status of the importer at the time of importation.</p><p><em><u>Deferred payment to the time of filing VAT return</u></em></p><p>In certain situations, an importer may be able to account for VAT in the VAT return which relates to the tax period in which the goods are imported. In order for this to occur, the importer must meet the following conditions: <sup><a href='#bookmark20' id='bookmarkback20'>[20]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the importer is registered for VAT at the time of import;</p></li><li><p>the importer has sufficient details for the FTA to verify the import and the VAT which is due on the import and is able to provide these as required;</p></li><li><p>the importer has provided the FTA with its own Customs registration number issued by the competent Customs department for the import in question; and</p></li><li><p>the importer has cooperated with, and complied with any rules imposed by the FTA in respect of the import.</p></li></ul><p>In practice, these conditions require that a VAT-registered importer registers their Customs registration number with the FTA prior to importing goods into the UAE (this can be done at the time of registering for VAT or at a later time). When any goods are subsequently imported into the UAE by this importer using the Customs registration number which is registered with the FTA, no VAT will be charged at the time of import and the goods will be released to the importer as soon as other customs formalities are completed. The applicable import VAT would then be prepopulated as output tax in box 6 of the importer&apos;s next VAT return. It should be noted that the importer has an ongoing obligation to ensure that the VAT return reflects the correct VAT payable in respect of the import &ndash; as a consequence, the importer should review the correctness of the import VAT prepopulated in its VAT return and should make adjustments in box 7 of the VAT return, if necessary.</p><p>VAT incurred on imports is treated as input tax of the importer, and the importer may be able to recover it in box 10 of its VAT return, if eligible under the normal VAT recovery rules as discussed in Part 2.7 of this Guide. Where the importer is entitled to recover the input tax in full, it will not represent a cost to the business.</p><p><em><u>Payment at the time of import</u></em></p><p>In situations where the conditions for deferring the payment of import VAT are not met &ndash; for example, the importer is not registered for VAT at the time of import &ndash; the importer would need to pay VAT to the FTA before the goods can be released to it by the relevant Customs department. This process requires the importer to use the FTA&apos;s e- Services portal to complete the VAT301 &ndash; Import Declaration Form for VAT Payment and to make the payment of applicable VAT.</p><p>Please refer to the VAT Import Declaration User Guide for detailed guidance regarding accounting for import VAT by non-registered importers.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.5.2'><h3>Import with assistance of an import clearing agent</h3><p>Often, the task of importing goods into the UAE and fulfilling all importation formalities are delegated to a clearing agent. For example, the task of clearing the goods through Customs may be undertaken by a specialised clearing agent, a freight forwarder responsible for delivering the goods to the purchaser, or a third party local company.</p><p>Where a clearing agent or equivalent business is importing goods on behalf of a VAT- registered importer, the clearing agent should declare the importer&apos;s TRN on the customs import declaration. This will allow the importer to account for the import VAT in its VAT return as described in Part 3.5.1.</p><p>On the other hand, where a clearing agent is importing goods on behalf of a non- registered importer, the agent should declare its own TRN or C/O TRN <sup><a href='#bookmark21' id='bookmarkback21'>[21]</a> </sup>on the customs import declaration and should be responsible for the payment of VAT in respect of the import in its VAT return. <sup><a href='#bookmark22' id='bookmarkback22'>[22]</a></sup></p><p>It should be noted that since the clearing agent or equivalent business is not the owner of the goods, but simply facilitates the import of those goods into the UAE, <b>it should not recover the import VAT as its own input tax in the VAT return, and doing so would expose the clearing agent </b>or equivalent business <b>to an assessment for over-recovered VAT and penalties</b>. Instead, if the VAT is paid by the clearing agent or equivalent business, it can be recovered by the agent directly from the importer. To do so, the clearing agent or equivalent business must issue a statement to the importer which contains, at the minimum, the following details: <sup><a href='#bookmark23' id='bookmarkback23'>[23]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>the name, address, and TRN of the clearing agent or equivalent business;</p></li><li><p>the date on which the statement is issued;</p></li><li><p>the date of import of the relevant goods;</p></li><li><p>a description of the imported goods which is sufficient to identify them; and</p></li><li><p>the amount of VAT paid by the agent to the FTA in respect of the imported goods.</p></li></ul><p>It should be noted that the statement issued by the clearing agent is treated as a <i>de facto </i>tax invoice for VAT purposes. As a consequence, the importer is able to rely on the statement to recover VAT if and when available (for example, if the non-registered importer registers for VAT at a later date and it was eligible to recover the input tax paid before registration).</p><p>The FTA requires all agents to retain copies of these statements, so that they are available for inspection when the FTA undertakes audits of these agents&apos; VAT accounts.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.5.3'><h3>Exceptions from import VAT</h3><p>Certain categories of goods are relieved from import VAT. In some cases, these categories generally mirror reliefs which are available in respect of customs duties, therefore allowing certain goods not to be subject to both VAT and customs duties.</p><p><em><u>Import VAT suspension</u></em></p><p>Goods are not treated as imported into the UAE where they are under customs duty suspension arrangements in accordance with the GCC Common Customs Law under any of the following categories: <sup><a href='#bookmark24' id='bookmarkback24'>[24]</a></sup></p><ol><li><p>temporary admission;</p></li><li><p>goods placed in a customs warehouse;</p></li><li><p>goods in transit; or</p></li><li><p>imported goods intended to be re-exported by the same person.</p></li></ol><p>Where any of the above exceptions apply, the movement of goods into the UAE is not treated as an import, and therefore not subject to import VAT. If any conditions for the VAT suspension are subsequently broken, the goods may be treated as having been imported into the UAE and the VAT will become due on the import from the date the goods were originally imported.</p><p>In order to benefit from the above VAT exception, the importer is required to provide a financial guarantee to the FTA for the amount of VAT chargeable in respect of the goods. This guarantee will be refunded by the FTA once the goods leave the UAE in accordance with the relevant customs suspension conditions. It should be noted that where an import is facilitated by a clearing agent who has a TINCO registration, the TINCO agent can use its own guarantee with the FTA, and ask the importer for a guarantee or cash deposit which will be refunded once the goods leave the UAE.</p><p><em><u>Import VAT exemption</u></em></p><p>In certain situations, imports of goods into the UAE are fully exempt from VAT. The exemption applies to goods which are treated as exempt from Customs duty under any of the following categories: <sup><a href='#bookmark25' id='bookmarkback25'>[25]</a></sup></p><ol><li><p>goods imported by the military forces, and internal security forces;</p></li><li><p>personal effects and gifts accompanied by travelers;</p></li><li><p>used personal effects and household items transported by UAE nationals living abroad on return or expats moving to live in the UAE for first time; or</p></li><li><p>returned goods.</p></li></ol><p>The last of the above categories may apply in respect of goods which were sold and exported from the UAE, but then returned to the supplier in the UAE.

For example, a supply of legal or financial advice, transport services, or hotel accommodation will not constitute an electronic service simply because the parties use the internet to communicate with each other or to facilitate bookings.</p><p>The second requirement means that an electronic service should be automatically delivered over the internet, an electronic network, or an electronic marketplace with minimal or no human intervention. Thus, although a small degree of human intervention is acceptable to enable or complete a supply, this intervention should not change the nature of the delivery of a service as being essentially automated. For example, where a recipient receives a manually generated email with a download link for the software which he has picked from the supplier&apos;s website, the software can be still considered automatically delivered &ndash; the human intervention of sending an email with a download link is too insignificant to change the nature of the supply.</p><p>The above example can be contrasted with a situation where a recipient commissions customised software which has to be developed by the supplier before being put on the supplier&apos;s website to be available to the recipient. In this situation, the human involvement from the supplier in developing the software is critical to the supplier&apos;s ability to make the supply of services. As a consequence, the services cannot be treated as automatically delivered to the recipient.</p><p>It should be noted that a supply of electronic services may be made through an electronic marketplace rather than directly by the supplier to the recipient. &ldquo;Electronic marketplace&rdquo; means a distribution service which is operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, or distribution platform, and meets both of the following conditions: <sup><a href='#bookmark27' id='bookmarkback27'>[27]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>it allows suppliers to make supplies of electronic services to recipients; and</p></li><li><p>the supplies made by the marketplace must be made by electronic means.</p></li></ul><p>Where a supplier makes a supply of electronic services through an electronic marketplace, and the electronic marketplace is not acting in a capacity as an undisclosed agent, then the supply is treated as made by the principal supplier directly to the recipient of the supply. On the other hand, where the electronic marketplace acts as an undisclosed agent for the principal supplier, there will be two supplies for VAT purposes &ndash; a supply by the principal supplier to the marketplace and the supply by the marketplace to the principal recipient. The VAT consequences of making supplies through agents, such as electronic marketplaces, are discussed in detail in Chapter 5 of this Guide.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.2'><h3>Place of supply of electronic services</h3><p>Supplies of electronic services (as well as of telecommunications services) are subject to a special place of supply rule. Thus, the place of supply of electronic services is: <sup><a href='#bookmark28' id='bookmarkback28'>[28]</a></sup></p><ul><li><p>in the UAE, to the extent of the use and enjoyment of the supply in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>outside the UAE, to the extent of the use and enjoyment of the supply outside the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>The reference to the &ldquo;extent&rdquo; in Article 31 indicates that a single supply may be apportioned for the purposes of a place of supply rules, so that it is treated as partly in the UAE and partly outside the UAE. This ability to apportion a supply is, however, limited to situations where a sufficient distinction exists between the different parts of the supply (i.e. services supplied) or consideration (amounts charged for such services) so as it is practical and reasonable to divide them.</p><p>The actual use and enjoyment of electronic services should be determined on the basis of where the electronic services are consumed by the recipient, regardless of the place of contract or payment. <sup><a href='#bookmark29' id='bookmarkback29'>[29]</a> </sup>Since the legislation does not provide any express rule regarding the indicators which should be used to determine the place of use and enjoyment, this determination must be made on a case-by-case basis, and all of the facts of the supply must be considered.</p><p>Nevertheless, the following principles may be used as high-level guidance in determining the place of use and enjoyment in various scenarios:</p><ul><li><p>In the case of an electronic service which is delivered to a physical place, the place of use and enjoyment of that service is that physical place. For example, where electronic services content can be only accessed from a particular physical location, that location will be the place of use and enjoyment.</p></li><li><p>In the case of electronic services provided on a portable device, the use and enjoyment may be determined on the basis of the recipient&apos;s location at the time the services are supplied. For example, where music is electronically delivered to a recipient located in the UAE, the place of use and enjoyment will be the UAE.</p><p>For the purpose of determining the location of the recipient, some of the factors which may be indicative of the recipient&apos;s location are:</p><ul><li><p>the internet protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address of the device used by the recipient to receive the electronic service;</p></li><li><p>the country code stored on the SIM card used by the recipient to receive the electronic service;</p></li><li><p>the place of residence of the recipient;</p></li><li><p>the billing address of the recipient; and / or</p></li><li><p>the bank details used by the recipient for the payment.</p></li></ul><p>In determining the location of the recipient, the supplier should give priority to the factors which give the most precise information regarding the actual place where the electronic services will be used and enjoyed. For example, if a KSA resident orders an on-demand film to be watched on a computer with an IP address in the UAE, the use and enjoyment of the film will be in the UAE.</p></li></ul></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.3'><h3>Imposition of VAT</h3><p>The place of supply of electronic services determines whether or not the services are subject to VAT in the UAE. Where the place of supply is outside the UAE, no UAE VAT would apply. In contrast, where the place of supply is in the UAE, the supply will fall within the UAE VAT net.</p><p>The default VAT rate on a taxable supply of services in the UAE is 5%. The supply may, however, be zero-rated if it falls under any of the zero-rating scenarios in Article 45 of the Decree-Law. For example, a supply of an electronic service of distance learning which is automatically delivered over the internet may be zero-rated if it is covered by Article 45(13) of the Decree-Law, read with Article 40 of the Executive Regulation.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.4'><h3>Accounting for VAT</h3><p>Similar to supplies of goods discussed in Part 3.3.2 of this Guide, the responsibility for accounting for VAT on any taxable supply of electronic services in the UAE typically lies with the taxable supplier of those electronic services, unless the reverse charge mechanism applies.</p><p>In respect of cross-border supplies of electronic services into the UAE (i.e. import of services into the UAE from abroad), the reverse charge mechanism applies where the supplier does not have a place of residence in the UAE and the recipient is either registered or required to register for VAT in the UAE. <sup><a href='#bookmark30' id='bookmarkback30'>[30]</a></sup></p><p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies to a supply, the recipient, rather than the non-resident supplier, must account for the VAT to the FTA at the applicable VAT rate. The VAT should be charged on top of the agreed price for the electronic services. <sup><a href='#bookmark31' id='bookmarkback31'>[31]</a></sup></p><p>Since the reverse charge mechanism is an exception to the default rule of accounting for VAT, it should only be used where the supplier can ascertain that all of the conditions for the application of the reverse charge are met. If the non-resident supplier cannot ascertain the necessary particulars for the application of the reverse charge mechanism to a particular supply, then the responsibility to account for VAT remains with the supplier.</p><p>Since the reverse charge mechanism is only applicable when specific conditions are met, taxable supplies from the same non-resident supplier of electronic services may be subject to different VAT accounting treatments &ndash; while a taxable supply made to a UAE taxable person would be subject to the reverse charge mechanism under Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law, the same supply made to a non-taxable person would not be subject to the reverse charge mechanism and would continue being the obligation of the supplier. As such, the supplier may continue being responsible for accounting for VAT on supplies which are not subject to the reverse charge mechanism.</p><p>For example, if a non-resident supplier of cross-border electronic services makes supplies to both taxable and non-taxable persons, it will be liable to register for VAT and to account for UAE VAT on its supplies to non-taxable persons. However, tax on its supplies to taxable persons is the responsibility of its customers, who shall be responsible to account for VAT under Article 48(1) of the Decree-Law. Note that this treatment is only applicable to cross-border supplies of services, and the rules for goods are different, as explained in 3.3.2 of this Guide (which refers to the reverse charge mechanism under Article 48(3) of the Executive Regulation as applicable to supplies of goods with the place of supply in the UAE).</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.5'><h3>Summary: VAT treatment of electronic services</h3><p>The table below summarises the high-level indicative VAT treatment of various scenarios related to supplies of electronic services.</p><table><tr><th>Residency status of supplier</th><th>Place of use and enjoyment</th><th>Registration status of recipient</th><th>VAT on supply</th><th>VAT accounted by</th></tr><tr><td><p>UAE</p></td><td><p>UAE</p></td><td><p>Any</p></td><td><p>5% or 0% if</p><p>specifically zero-rated</p></td><td><p>Supplier*</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>UAE</p></td><td><p>Outside UAE</p></td><td><p>Any</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Outside UAE</p></td><td><p>UAE</p></td><td><p>Not registered</p></td><td><p>5% or 0% if</p><p>specifically zero-rated</p></td><td><p>Supplier</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Outside UAE</p></td><td><p>UAE</p></td><td><p>Registered</p></td><td><p>5% or 0% specifically</p><p>zero-rated</p></td><td><p>Recipient</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Outside UAE</p></td><td><p>Outside UAE</p></td><td><p>Any</p></td><td><p>No</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='5'></td></tr><tr><td colspan='5'><p>Note:</p><p>* The UAE-resident supplier will only be responsible for accounting for VAT on the supply where it is a taxable person in the UAE.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan='5'></td></tr></table></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection5'><h3>Supplies made through agents</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection5.1'><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In the context of e-commerce, supplies of goods and services are often made using electronic platforms, portals, gateway or marketplaces (&ldquo;electronic marketplaces&rdquo;). Such electronic marketplaces may sell goods or services themselves, as well as act as intermediaries between the supplier and the recipient of goods or services.</p><p>Where an electronic marketplace makes any supplies of goods or services in its capacity as a principal supplier (for example, it buys and then sells goods), then the electronic marketplace is treated as the supplier of those goods or services for VAT purposes. As a consequence, the electronic marketplace would be required to comply with the VAT rules and obligations which are typically applicable to suppliers of those goods or services.</p><p>Where an electronic marketplace is not acting as a principal supplier of goods or services, it may act as an intermediary which enables a sale of goods and services. For example, an electronic marketplace may be used to advertise products, make bookings, process payments, and arrange deliveries of goods and services.</p><p>The VAT treatment of supplies using intermediaries will depend on the arrangement between the supplier, the intermediary and the recipient of the supply:</p><ul><li><p>Where the intermediary is acting as a disclosed agent (as defined and explained in Part 5.2 below) between the supplier and the recipient of the supply, then the supply is treated as made directly by the supplier to the recipient.</p></li><li><p>Where the intermediary is acting as an undisclosed agent (as defined and explained in Part 5.2) between the supplier and the recipient of the supply, then there are two supplies for VAT purposes &ndash; from the supplier to the intermediary, and from the intermediary to the recipient.</p></li></ul><p>The rest of this Chapter discusses VAT rules applicable to supplies of goods or services made through intermediaries in their capacities as agents acting on behalf of a principal.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.2'><h3>Types of agency arrangements</h3><p>An agent is a person who acts on behalf of another person in respect of a specific task. In a commercial transaction, an agent can act on behalf of a supplier of goods or services, or on behalf of a recipient of goods or services, or both. In the context of e-commerce, an agent is typically an intermediary which is authorised by the principal supplier to act on its behalf in finding, and dealing with, customers.</p><p>From a VAT perspective, a different VAT treatment applies to supplies made through disclosed and undisclosed agents. As a consequence, it is important to be able to determine whether or not an intermediary is acting as a disclosed or an undisclosed agent:</p><ul><li><p>A disclosed agent is an agent which acts on behalf and in the name of a principal. In disclosed agency situations, the recipient of the supply knows that it is dealing with an agent of a principal, even if the recipient may not have any direct communication with the principal.</p></li><li><p>An undisclosed agent is an agent acting in its own name, where the customer has no knowledge, and cannot be reasonably expected to have knowledge, that the agent is acting on behalf of a principal. It should be noted that this situation is different from situations where no other principal is involved at all and the &ldquo;intermediary&rdquo; is a principal itself &ndash; in undisclosed agency situation, the agent is still acting on behalf of a principal.</p></li></ul><p>In order to determine the existence and the disclosed / undisclosed nature of an agency relationship, the starting point is to analyse contractual arrangements between parties. The contractual arrangement should typically be taken as representative of the true relationship between parties unless it is clearly a sham or is fundamentally inconsistent with the reality of the actual transaction. In interpreting contractual arrangements, it is only necessary to consider information which has been made available to the parties at the time they entered the agreement. For example, the fact that there is an agency agreement between the principal supplier and the agent does not in itself imply that this fact should be known to an unsuspecting recipient of the supply.</p><p>It should be noted that in some situations, a person may be described as an &ldquo;agent&rdquo;, but will in practice make supplies of goods or services on its own account. For VAT purposes, such labels should be ignored and the person should be treated as a principal in respect of the relevant supplies.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.3'><h3>VAT treatment of supplies made through agents</h3><p>The VAT treatment of supplies made through agents differs depending on whether it is a disclosed or undisclosed agency.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection5.3.1'><h3>Disclosed agency</h3><p>In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Decree-Law, a supply of goods and services through an agent acting in the name of and on behalf of a principal, i.e. through a disclosed agent, is considered to be a supply by the principal and for his benefit.</p><p>The above means that where an agent, such as an electronic marketplace, is acting as a disclosed agent of the principal supplier in respect of a supply of goods or services, then the supply of these goods or services is treated as made directly by the principal supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a result, the VAT obligations for the supply will remain with the principal supplier, and the principal supplier should account for this VAT in its tax return if required under the normal VAT rules.</p><p><em><u>VAT treatment of agency services</u></em></p><p>Where an agent is charging an agency fee or commission for its agency services, these agency services should be treated as a separate supply of services from the supply of the underlying goods or services.</p><p>Where the place of supply of such agency services is in the UAE, the services are considered a taxable supply. It should be noted that the place of supply for agency services provided by agents must be determined independently from the place of supply of the underlying goods and services, and therefore can differ from the place of supply of such goods or services. For example, where a UAE agent provides agency services to a UAE supplier of electronic services which have a place of supply in the USA under the use and enjoyment rules, the place of supply of the agency services would still be in the UAE.</p><p>The default VAT rate for a taxable supply of agency services in the UAE is 5%. However, in certain situations, the services may be zero-rated where they are supplied to a non-resident principal. <sup><a href='#bookmark32' id='bookmarkback32'>[32]</a> </sup>For zero-rating to apply, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li><p>the agency services are supplied to a recipient who does not have a place of residence in the UAE or any Implementing State and who is outside the UAE at the time the services are performed;</p></li><li><p>the agency services are not supplied directly in connection with any real estate or goods situated in the UAE at the time the services are performed; and</p></li><li><p>the performance of the agency services is not received by another person in the UAE who is unable to recover any input tax in full. <sup><a href='#bookmark33' id='bookmarkback33'>[33]</a></sup></p></li></ul><p>The application of this zero-rating provision must be determined by reference to the specific services provided by the agent. For example, while agency services relating to the provision of an electronic platform to allow a principal to sell goods or services in the UAE may be eligible to be zero-rated, a service of physically handling and delivering goods would not be eligible for zero-rating since they would be directly in connection with the goods in the UAE.</p><p>It should be noted that where an agent does not charge a fee or commission for its services, VAT would not be applicable on the services.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.3.2'><h3>Undisclosed agency</h3><p>In accordance with Article 9(2) of the Decree-Law, a supply of goods and services through an agent acting in its name, i.e. through an undisclosed agent, is considered to be a direct supply by the agent and for his benefit.</p><p>Where an undisclosed agent is involved in a supply of any goods or services, there are two simultaneous supplies of these goods or services for VAT purposes &ndash; a supply from the principal supplier to the undisclosed agent, and a supply from the undisclosed agent to the recipient of the supply. In effect, the undisclosed agent is treated as both the buyer and the seller of the goods or services.</p><p>The simultaneous supplies means that both the principal supplier and the undisclosed agent must separately charge VAT applicable on the supply of the underlying goods or services, and must account for this VAT to the FTA in their own VAT returns. Where it is eligible under the general input tax recovery rules, the undisclosed agent may also recover the VAT which was charged to it by the principal supplier &ndash; this ensures that this VAT is not a cost to the agent.</p><p><em><u>VAT treatment of agency services</u></em></p><p>As discussed in Part 5.3.1, where an undisclosed agent and the principal agree that the agent can charge a separate agency fee or commission for the agency services to the principal, the agent must consider the VAT treatment of this services separately from the VAT treatment of the underlying supply of goods or services.</p><p>On the other hand, where the agent is able to embed the fee as a mark-up to the sale price of the goods or services, then the VAT treatment of the agency services should follow the VAT treatment of the underlying goods or services.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.4'><h3>Tax invoice requirements</h3><p>As a default rule, a VAT-registered supplier of a taxable supply of goods or services is required to issue an original tax invoice and deliver it to the recipient of the supply. <sup><a href='#bookmark34' id='bookmarkback34'>[34]</a> </sup>This condition applies irrespective of whether the goods are sold directly or through an electronic marketplace.</p><p>As an exception to the default rule, where a VAT-registered agent makes a supply of goods or services on behalf of a principal, the agent may issue a tax invoice in relation to that supply as if that agent had made the supply. <sup><a href='#bookmark35' id='bookmarkback35'>[35]</a> </sup>A tax invoice issued by the agent must contain all the usual particulars required under Article 59 of the Executive Regulation, but may include the agent&apos;s, rather than the supplier&apos;s, details &ndash; in which case, the invoice should, however, contain a reference to the principal supplier (including the supplier&apos;s name and TRN) somewhere on the invoice.</p><p>Only one tax invoice may be issued for any supply of goods or services. Therefore, this option is not available where the principal supplier has already issued a tax invoice. Similarly, where an agent has issued a tax invoice in respect of a supply made by the principal, the agent must ensure that the principal receives a copy of that tax invoice, and the principal should not issue its own tax invoice in respect of the same supply.</p><p>It is important to note that where the invoice is issued by the agent, the supply is still treated as being made by the principal supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a consequence, the supplier has to account for the relevant VAT and must comply with all the record-keeping requirements in respect of the supply.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that where an agent is an undisclosed agent which is treated as making the supply under Article 9(2) of the Decree-Law, the undisclosed agent has the responsibility to issue a tax invoice in its own name.</p></article></section></article></section></main><footer><section><article><h3>Footnotes</h3><em><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback1' id='bookmark1'>[1]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-1'>Article 1</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback2' id='bookmark2'>[2]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-3'>Article 3</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback3' id='bookmark3'>[3]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-45'>Article 45</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback4' id='bookmark4'>[4]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-1'>Article 1</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback5' id='bookmark5'>[5]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-13'>Article 13</a> of the Decree-Law</span> and <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-7'>Article 7</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback6' id='bookmark6'>[6]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-19'>Article 19</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback7' id='bookmark7'>[7]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-17'>Article 17</a> of the Decree-Law</span> and <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-8'>Article 8</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback8' id='bookmark8'>[8]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-48'>Article 48</a>(1) of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback9' id='bookmark9'>[9]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-1'>Article 1</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback10' id='bookmark10'>[10]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-48'>Article 48</a>(3) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback11' id='bookmark11'>[11]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-54'>Article 54</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback12' id='bookmark12'>[12]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-55'>Article 55</a>(1) of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback13' id='bookmark13'>[13]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-55'>Article 55</a>(2) of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback14' id='bookmark14'>[14]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-27'>Article 27</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback15' id='bookmark15'>[15]</a></sup><span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-41'>Article 41</a>(4) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback16' id='bookmark16'>[16]</a></sup>&ldquo;Overseas Customer&rdquo;

As a general consumption tax on the supply of goods and services, it applies to those supplies which take place within the territorial area of the UAE.</p><p>Historically, Free Zones have been excluded from the territorial scope of the UAE. For VAT purposes, this is not automatically the case. Only those Free Zones listed in a Cabinet Decision qualify for special VAT treatment and that special VAT treatment has certain limitations. These nominated Free Zones are known as Designated Zones for VAT purposes.</p><p>Designated Zones are:</p><ul><li><p>subject to strict control criteria;</p></li><li><p>required to have security procedures in place to control the movement of goods and people to and from the Designated Zone;</p></li><li><p>required to have Customs procedures to control the movement of goods into and out of the Designated Zone; and</p></li><li><p>treated as being outside the territory of the UAE for VAT purposes for certain supplies of goods.</p></li></ul><p>The effect for businesses operating in Designated Zones will be that many supplies of goods will be outside the scope of UAE VAT, subject to strict criteria and detailed record keeping. However, supplies of services are subject to the normal UAE VAT rules.</p><p>Strict qualifying criteria are applied to limit the use of the Designated Zones measure to those businesses for which it is designed, i.e. it is a measure to facilitate international trade on a VAT neutral basis and is not one designed to enable tax avoidance at any level.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.2'><h3>Purpose of this document</h3><p>This document contains more detailed guidance about the characteristics of a Free Zone which must be present in order for it to qualify as a Designated Zone for VAT purposes.</p><p>In addition, this document provides guidance for businesses operating in Designated Zones seeking to understand the VAT implications of their activities within and outside the Designated Zones.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.3'><h3>Who should read this document?</h3><p>This document should be read by key stakeholders in businesses operating in Designated Zones who are responsible for tax matters.</p></article></section></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection2'><h3>Identification of Designated Zones</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection2.1'><h3>VAT treatment of Free Zones</h3><p>VAT is a general consumption tax imposed on most supplies of goods and services in the UAE.

Those Free Zones which are Designated Zones are treated as being outside of the territory of the UAE for VAT purposes for specific supplies of goods.</p><p>In addition, there are special VAT rules in respect of VAT treatment of certain supplies made within Designated Zones. The effect of these rules is that <em>certain </em>supplies of <em>goods </em>made within Designated Zones are not be subject to UAE VAT. In contrast, supplies of <em>services </em>made within Designated Zones are treated in the same way as supplies of services in the rest of the UAE.</p><div class='example'><p><strong>Important:</strong> Free Zones meeting the criteria have been specifically identified by way of a Cabinet Decision as <strong>Designated Zones.</strong> Where a Free Zone is not a Designated Zone, it is treated like any other part of the UAE.</p></div></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.2'><h3>Identification of a Designated Zone</h3><p>A Designated Zone is an area specified by a Cabinet Decision as being a &ldquo;Designated Zone&rdquo; <sup><a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a> </sup>. Free Zones listed by the Cabinet Decision as being a Designated Zone can be found under the Legislation tab on the FTA website (<a href='http://www.tax.gov.ae'>www.tax.gov.ae</a>).</p><p>Although an area might be identified as a Designated Zone, it is not automatically treated as being outside the UAE for VAT purposes. There are several main criteria <sup><a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a></sup></p><p>which must be met in order for a Designated Zone to be treated as outside the UAE for VAT purposes.

Since UAE VAT only applies on supplies made in the UAE, such special treatment of Designated Zones will affect the VAT treatment of supplies made within Designated Zones.</p><p>This section of the Guide discusses the consequences of treating Designated Zones as being outside the UAE for various types of transactions.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.2'><h3>Supply of services</h3><p>The place of supply of services is considered to be within the UAE if, under the normal rules, the place of supply would be the Designated Zone <sup><a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a> </sup>.</p><p>This override to the normal place of supply of services rules means that, in all circumstances, the place of supply of services supplied in Designated Zones reverts to being in the UAE. Such supplies are then taxed in accordance with the general VAT rules for supplies of such services.</p><p>This means that most services will be liable to VAT at the standard rate, as would be the case were they performed within the UAE. Equally, where services are exported (i.e. made to a person who is resident and located outside the GCC Implementing States), then the services may be zero-rated.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.3'><h3>Supply of goods within a Designated Zone</h3><p>As outlined above, Designated Zones will be treated as being &rsquo;offshore&apos; if the necessary conditions are met.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection3.3.1'><h3>Default rule</h3><p>Since the place of supply for goods generally follows the location of the goods, a supply of goods within a Designated Zone is treated as made outside the UAE. This means that the default position is that such supplies are not subject to UAE VAT.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.3.2'><h3>Override of the default rule</h3><p>This default position is overridden where a supply of goods is made within a Designated Zone to a person to be consumed by him or another person &ndash; in these situations, the place of supply will be treated in the UAE and VAT will be applicable under the normal rules.</p><p>In the above context, the term &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; should be interpreted broadly as including any utilisation, application, employment, deployment or exploitation of the goods. For the purpose of the provision, the resale of purchased goods is not treated as consumption of the goods. Therefore, a supply of goods in such circumstances would still be outside the scope of VAT if the purchaser intends to sell them.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that the override does not apply, and the supply can still be treated as being outside the scope of VAT, when the purchased goods are:</p><ul><li><p>incorporated into, attached to or otherwise form part of another good located in the same Designated Zone and that other good is not consumed; or</p></li><li><p>used in the production of another good located in the same Designated Zone and that other good is not consumed.</p></li></ul><p>For the purposes of the second exception to the override, there must be a direct connection between the purchased goods and the production of another good. For example, the exception will generally apply to tools and equipment used to manufacture other goods; in contrast, a computer used by the business to create designs for goods which are later manufactured will not have sufficient connection with the goods to be treated as &ldquo;used in the production&rdquo; of the goods.</p><p>The following are some of the examples of the application of <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-51'>Article 51</a>(5) of the Executive Regulations to supplies taking place in Designated Zones.</p><table><tr><th>Example of supply</th><th>VAT treatment of the supply for UAE VAT</th><th>Comments</th></tr><tr><td><p>A business buys trading stock for the purpose of resale within the Designated Zone.</p></td><td><p>Outside the scope</p></td><td><p>The resale of the goods is not treated as consumption of the goods in the context of Art 51(5) of the VAT Executive</p><p>Regulations.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>An oil equipment manufacturer in the Designated Zone buys steel which will be used in production of equipment.</p><p>The manufactured equipment is then sold by the manufacturer.</p></td><td><p>Outside the scope</p></td><td><p>Although steel will be &ldquo;consumed&rdquo; by the manufacturer, this steel will be form part of the manufactured equipment which itself will not be consumed by the manufacturer.

Therefore, similar to supplies of other goods within Designated Zones, such supplies may be treated as being outside the scope of the UAE if they meet conditions discussed in part 3.3 of this Guide.</p><p>However, where water or energy is supplied for consumption (e.g. water and electricity provided by a water and electricity authority), then the place of supply of such water and energy reverts to being treated as being within the UAE <sup><a href='#bookmark14' id='bookmarkback14'>[14]</a> </sup>and the supply is subject to the normal VAT treatment. This override applies even if the water or energy is used in the process of production of other goods in the Designated Zone. This means that suppliers of water and energy shall charge VAT without the need to distinguish between the potential uses for water and energy.</p><p>For the purpose of the rule, the term &ldquo;energy&rdquo; includes electricity and gas, including biogas, coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, oil gas, producer gas, refinery gas, reformed natural gas, and tempered liquefied petroleum gas, and any mixture of gases, whether used for lighting, or heating, or cooling, or air conditioning or any other purpose. <sup><a href='#bookmark15' id='bookmarkback15'>[15]</a></sup></p><p>It should be noted that the rule only applies to water and energy sold for the purpose of consumption. Supplies of oil, gas, and other similar goods traded by businesses within Designated Zones may still be outside the scope of UAE VAT if the necessary conditions are met.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.2'><h3>Supplies of real estate</h3><p>Supplies of real estate, which include the sale and lease of real estate, are treated as supplies of goods. The place of supply of such supplies is where the real estate is located.</p><p>It should be noted that real estate is not treated as consumed when sold or leased within a Designated Zone and therefore such supplies of real estate are not brought into the scope of UAE VAT by <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-51'>Article 51</a>(5) of the Executive Regulations. As such, supplies of real estate made within Designated Zones are outside the scope of VAT.</p><p>In light of the above, raw materials purchased within a Designated Zone for the purpose of constructing real estate in the Designated Zone are also outside the scope of VAT. This is because the raw materials will be used in the production of another good (the real estate) located in the same Designated Zone which itself is not consumed.</p><p>Where real estate is not supplied by way of sale or a lease, it is a supply of services related to real estate. This includes, but is not limited to granting a personal right to use real estate, licences to occupy real estate, the provision of contractual rights exercisable over or in relation to real estate, including the right to use accommodation in a hotel or similar establishment, and similar <sup><a href='#bookmark16' id='bookmarkback16'>[16]</a> </sup>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier in this Guide, the place of supply of <u>all</u> services is considered to be within the UAE if, under the normal rules, the place of supply would be within a Designated Zone. <sup><a href='#bookmark17' id='bookmarkback17'>[17]</a> </sup>As a result, supplies of services related to real estate will be taxable even if supplied within a Designated Zone.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.3'><h3>Tax groups (VAT groups)</h3><p>For tax grouping purposes, a business established within a Designated Zone (which is still treated as a UAE business) is able to form a tax group with an onshore company (or companies) or another Designated Zone company (or companies), subject to meeting the normal control criteria.</p><p>The usual consequences of tax grouping follow, such as supplies between members being disregarded for VAT purposes, and there being joint and several liability of the members of the tax group.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that where a supply of goods between the tax group members results in the goods being moved from a Designated Zone into the UAE mainland, this importation of the goods would trigger the obligation to pay import VAT. The payment of import VAT will be done using the normal process for such payments &ndash; that is, a VAT registered tax group will be able to defer accounting for the VAT to its VAT return.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.4'><h3>Branches</h3><p>A single entity may have a branch or head office located in a Designated Zone and a branch or head office located in the UAE mainland.</p><p>Supplies between different parts of the same legal entity, for example, between the head office and the branch, are treated as intra-entity supplies for VAT purposes and therefore disregarded.</p><p>Similar to the tax groups, it should be noted that a movement of goods from a Designated Zone into the mainland UAE may trigger the obligation to pay import VAT (e.g. when transferring goods from the branch in the Designated Zone to the head office in the mainland). <span>A</span>VAT registered entity will be able to defer accounting for import VAT to its VAT return;

Therefore, it is necessary to identify whether a director is a taxable person who makes taxable supplies.</p><p>&ldquo;<em><u>Taxable supply</u></em>&rdquo;</p><p>A &ldquo;taxable supply&rdquo; is defined in the VAT legislation as any supply of goods or services for consideration by a person conducting business in the UAE, excluding exempt supplies. Therefore, a supply would be a taxable supply if the following conditions are met:</p><ul><li><p>It is a supply of goods or services;</p></li><li><p>for consideration;</p></li><li><p>by a person conducting business;</p></li><li><p>in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>not an exempt supply.</p></li></ul><p>The Federal Decree-Law No. (8) of 2017 on Value Added Tax defines a &ldquo;supply of services&rdquo; to be any supply that is not considered a supply of goods. Directorship services would not be a supply of goods, and therefore is a supply of services for VAT purposes.</p><p>To be a taxable supply, services must usually be provided for consideration. &ldquo;Consideration&rdquo; is all that is received or expected to be received for the supply of the services, irrespective of whether in money or other forms of payment.</p><p>The third condition is that services must be provided by a person in the course of conducting business. The VAT legislation defines &ldquo;business&rdquo; as any activity conducted regularly, on an ongoing basis and independently by any person, in any location such as industrial, commercial, agricultural, professional, service or excavation activities or anything related to the use of tangible or intangible properties. This is a very broad definition, which may encompass most activities which are conducted regularly and independently. As a consequence, directorship activities would be able to be performed in the course of conduct of business.</p><p>The identification of whether or not services are provided in the UAE is done on the basis of place of supply rules. The default rule, subject to certain exceptions for cross- border supplies, is that the services are treated as taking place where the supplier is located. Therefore, generally, director&apos;s services provided by UAE residents will be treated as taking place in the UAE.</p><p>Finally, directorship services are not an exempt supply.</p><p>&ldquo;<em><u>Taxable person</u></em>&rdquo;</p><p>A &ldquo;taxable person&rdquo; is defined in the VAT legislation as any person registered or obligated to register for tax purposes.</p><p>A person is required to register for VAT if the total value of their taxable supplies and imports have exceeded the mandatory registration threshold of AED 375,000 in the preceding 12 months, or will exceed the threshold in the next 30 days. As discussed above, such calculation would include taxable supplies of director services.</p><p>A director may also choose to voluntarily register for VAT where the value of taxable supplies (including director fees) exceed the voluntary registration threshold of AED 187,500.</p><p>In conclusion, assuming a person provides services as a director regularly and independently (that is, they are not simply an employee of the company), the person will be required to charge VAT on their services.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.2'><h3>Determining Place of Supply for Director&apos;s Services provided</h3><p>UAE VAT is only charged where a supply is treated as taking place in the UAE.

As a general consumption tax on the supply of goods and services, it applies to taxable supplies which take place within the territorial area of the UAE.</p><p>Businesses in the automotive sector in the UAE are principally engaged in the trading of cars. The cars in question are usually manufactured overseas and are sold in the UAE through a network of authorized distributors. This guide discusses the VAT implications of certain activities common within the automotive sector, particularly in respect of the sale of cars, the import and export of cars and warranty supplies.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.2'><h3>Purpose of this document</h3><p>This document contains guidance about the VAT treatment of supplies made by motor vehicle dealers in the UAE including but not limited to the supply of new cars, the supply of used/ second-hand cars, supplies under warranty and the export and import of cars.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on how VAT affects businesses which operate within the automotive sector.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.3'><h3>Who should read this document?</h3><p>This document should be read by anyone responsible for tax matters in the automotive sector in the UAE, as well as their tax agents. It is intended to be read in conjunction with other relevant guidance published by the Federal Tax Authority (&ldquo;FTA&rdquo;).</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection1.1.4'><h3>Status of the document</h3><p>In this guide, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as &ldquo;Decree-Law&rdquo; and Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax and its amendments is referred to as &ldquo;Executive Regulation&rdquo;. This guidance is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the VAT legislation.</p><p>This guide is issued in accordance with Article 73 of the Executive Regulation and provides general guidance concerning the application of the Decree-Law and Executive Regulation in respect of the business activities within the automotive sector in the UAE.</p><p>It should be noted that this guide is not intended to provide comprehensive details associated with VAT and is not intended for legal reference but as a framework discussing VAT issues relevant specifically to the automotive sector. As a consequence, the guide does not provide an overview of the general operation of VAT but assumes that the reader already has an understanding of the basic principles of VAT. For details in respect of the general operation of VAT, refer to the <em>Taxable Person Guide &ndash; Value Added Tax </em><a href='http://www.tax.gov.ae/' target='_blank'>which is available on the FTA website (</a>www.tax.gov.ae).</p></article></section></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection2'><h3>Sale of Cars within the UAE</h3><p>The sale of cars within the UAE is subject to VAT at 5%. It is important to note that the sale of cars can be carried out by a number of different types of agreements. In this guide, the two most common types of agreements, i.e. outright sales and sale through hire-purchase arrangements, will be discussed. In addition, the guide will also explain the VAT implications in respect of the leasing of cars.</p><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection2.1'><h3>Outright sales</h3><p>The simplest form of sale of cars within the UAE is by way of an outright sale. This happens when a customer either has cash resources available or has borrowed funds from a financial institution to purchase the vehicle outright. The VAT implications of outright sales are as follows:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The supply of cars is subject to VAT at 5%. The date of supply<span>1 </span>is typically triggered by the earlier of one of the following events:</p><ul><li><p>the date on which the car is transferred to the customer;</p></li><li><p>the date on which the customer took possession of the car;</p></li><li><p>the date of receipt of payment; or</p></li><li><p>the date of issuance of a tax invoice.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Where the contract for the sale of cars involves periodic payments or consecutive invoices, the date of supply<span>2 </span>is the earliest of any of the following dates provided that it does not exceed one year from the provision of the car:</p><ul><li><p>the date of issuance of a tax invoice;</p></li><li><p>the date payment is due as shown on the tax invoice;</p></li><li><p>the date of receipt of payment.</p></li><p>It should be noted that where the date of supply is triggered because a payment is made or a tax invoice is issued in respect of a supply of a car, VAT will only be due<span>3 </span>to the extent of the payment made or stated on the tax invoice, and the remainder of the due tax on that supply will be payable as and when further dates of supply are triggered.</p></ul></li><li><p>A tax invoice must be issued within 14 days of the date of supply. The tax invoice must also be delivered to the customer. Please note that if you charge any amount as a disbursement for and on behalf of a Designated Government Entity (e.g. Transport Authority / Department) for provision of a Sovereign Activity, this amount should be clearly identified on the tax invoice and VAT should not be charged on this amount.</p></li><li><p>The output tax must be reported in the VAT return of the tax period in which the date of supply is triggered.</p></li></ol></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.2'><h3>Hire-purchase arrangements</h3><p>Where a motor vehicle trader sells cars to customers under hire-purchase arrangements, two separate supplies take place for VAT purposes. The first supply is by the motor vehicle trader to the finance company; and the second supply is by the finance company to the customer. For a car sold under such an arrangement, the motor vehicle trader transfers the ownership of the car to the finance company which lets the hirer use the car during the period of hire. The ownership of the car is passed to the hirer upon full payment of all the hire instalments.</p><ol type='a'><li><p>VAT treatment: Motor Vehicle Trade<span>r</span></p></li><p>As a supplier making a supply of a car to the finance company, a motor vehicle trader is required to issue a tax invoice to the finance company and account for VAT on the sale price of the car.</p><li><p>VAT treatment: Finance company</p></li></ol><p>The finance company is in turn required to issue invoices to the customer which will generally have two components: (a) the hire instalments which are subject to VAT; and (b) the interest amounts which are exempt for VAT purposes. However, if the finance charge is included in the total amount payable by the customer in instalments, then the total amount payable will be liable to VAT, as the amount will be subject to the same VAT treatment as the car itself.</p><p>It is important to note that often a finance company will issue consecutive invoices to the customer under the hire-purchase arrangement, for example monthly invoices for the term of the hire period. In such a case, the date of supply will be determined in accordance with Article 26 of the Decree-Law. Accordingly, whilst the finance company would have passed the possession of the car over to the customer at the beginning of the contract, it will not be under an obligation to account for VAT on the full value upfront. In contrast, the finance company will be able to account for VAT as and when it issues invoices (provided payments are not received prior to issuance of the invoices).</p><p><u>Repossession of cars sold under hire-purchase arrangements</u></p><p>Under a typical hire-purchase arrangement, a customer essentially receives a right to use the car from the finance company and at the end of the hire period, the ownership of the car passes from the finance company to the customer.</p><p>Where a finance company repossesses a car supplied under a hire-purchase arrangement before the expiry of the hire period, the right provided to use the car ceases. It is important to note that no supply takes place for VAT purposes on account of repossession of the car and therefore no VAT implications arise at this point. However, when the finance company further supplies the car to another customer, the normal VAT implications arise.</p><p>It is possible that a finance company may have issued tax invoice(s) to a customer for a certain period but is not able to collect the debt before repossessing the car. As the finance company would have accounted for VAT at the time of issuing the invoice, it will be entitled to adjust the output tax under the Bad Debt Scheme<span>4 </span>provided the prescribed conditions are met.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.3'><h3>Trade-ins</h3><p>It is a common practice for a customer to trade in an old car for a new car. In a trade- in situation, two separate supplies take place for VAT purposes:</p><ol><li><p>The sale of the new car to the customer; and</p></li><li><p>The customer&apos;s sale of the old car to the motor vehicle trader.</p></li></ol><p>For (a), the motor vehicle trader should account for VAT on the sales price of the new car. In computing the amount of VAT to charge on the sale of the new car, the motor vehicle trader should not net-off the trade-in value of the old car against the sales price of the new car.</p><p>The position stated above also applies to &rsquo;trade-in over allowances&apos; where a motor vehicle trader agrees to purchase an old car for a value higher than the market value. In such a case also, while accounting for VAT on the new car, the motor vehicle dealer should not net-off the trade-in value (including the over allowance) of the old car.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.4'><h3>Price display</h3><p>Cars are often displayed by motor vehicle traders in their showrooms. For sales of cars to the public, a motor trader vehicle must display, advertise, publish or quote VAT- inclusive prices. This is required so that the customer knows upfront the price that is payable for the car. For example, if the car is priced at AED 100,000 and the VAT applicable on the sale is AED 5,000, a motor vehicle trader must advertise the price as AED 105,000 with a stipulation that the price includes VAT.</p><p>There are two exceptions to the above rule where the advertised price is not required to be inclusive of VAT: (a) Where the supply of car is for export; and (b) Where the customer is registered for VAT. If any of the exceptions apply and a motor vehicle trader advertises the price as exclusive of VAT, it must clearly specify that the price is exclusive of VAT.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection2.5'><h3>Sale of cars to foreign governments, international organisations, diplomatic bodies and missions</h3><p>Sale of cars to foreign governments, international organisations, diplomatic bodies and missions, or an official thereof, are also subject to VAT at 5%. The foreign governments, international organisations, diplomatic bodies, missions or an official thereof may, however, seek a refund of such VAT incurred under the special VAT refund <span>5</span> scheme prescribed in the VAT legislation.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection3'><h3>Sale of used/ pre-owned cars</h3><p>The sale of used cars is also subject to VAT at 5%, provided the sale is made by a VAT registered supplier. The implications relating to the date of supply, invoicing obligations and payment of tax as discussed in section 2.1 above apply similarly to the sale of used cars. Further, the implications regarding price displays apply similarly to used cars as well &ndash; irrespective of whether the VAT is accounted for on the full sales value of the car or in accordance with the Profit Margin Scheme as discussed below.</p><p>A key difference between the VAT implications for the sale of new cars and the sale of used cars is the possibility of accounting for VAT using the Profit Margin Scheme which is available to motor vehicle dealers trading in used cars.</p><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection3.1'><h3>Profit Margin Scheme</h3><p>In accordance with the Profit Margin Scheme<span>6</span>, a VAT registered supplier can account for VAT on the basis of the profit earned on taxable supplies instead of accounting for VAT on the value of such supplies. In other words, under the Profit Margin Scheme, VAT can be accounted for on the difference between what was paid for a good at the time of purchasing it and what was charged to the customer at the time of selling it.</p><p>Amongst other things, the Profit Margin Scheme can also be used to account for VAT when selling used cars. It is important to note that applying the Profit Margin Scheme is optional. The rationale for the Profit Margin Scheme and the conditions which must be met for applying the scheme are discussed below.</p><section class='level-3'><article id='bookmarkSection3.1.1'><h3>Rationale for the Profit Margin Scheme</h3><p>The Profit Margin Scheme is intended to avoid the cascading of taxes. The cascading effect arises where a motor vehicle trader purchases a used car from a non-registered seller or from a seller who also accounted for VAT by reference to the Profit Margin Scheme and consequently the motor vehicle trader is not able to recover the VAT embedded in the price of the car. The Profit Margin Scheme seeks to avoid this cascading issue by permitting the motor vehicle trader to account for VAT only on the profit earned on the supply.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.1.2'><h3>Conditions for applying the Profit Margin Scheme</h3><p>The applicability of the Profit Margin Scheme is subject to meeting certain prescribed conditions. From the perspective of the sale of used cars, the conditions<span>7 </span>that are required to be satisfied by a motor vehicle trader are:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The car must have been purchased by the motor vehicle trader from:</p><ul><li><p>a non-taxable person; or</p></li><li><p>a taxable person who calculated tax on the supply by reference to the Profit Margin Scheme.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>As an alternative to condition (a), where the car is purchased from a VAT registered supplier, input tax must not have been recovered by reference to Article 53 of the Executive Regulation.</p></li><li><p>The car must have been subject to VAT before the supply in question. The FTA expects the motor vehicle trader to maintain documentation to evidence that the car was previously subject to VAT. For example, where the car is purchased from a non-taxable person with a view to making a further sale applying the Profit Margin Scheme, a copy of the tax invoice received by the non-taxable person at the time of the original purchase should be sufficient. If the non-taxable person does not have the tax invoice for any reason, it may engage with the original dealer from which the car was purchased. Alternatively, the non-taxable person can provide other documents such as its motor insurance policy or vehicle registration certificate issued by the relevant authority provided that such documents establish that VAT was charged on the original purchase.</p></li><li><p>The motor vehicle trader must issue a tax invoice that clearly states that the tax has been charged by reference to the profit margin, in addition to all other information required to be stated on a tax invoice with the <b>exception of the VAT amount.</b></p></li><li><p>The motor vehicle trader must keep the prescribed records and documents. The prescribed documents are:</p><ul><li><p>a stock book or a similar record showing details of each car purchased and sold under the Profit Margin Scheme;</p></li><li><p>Purchase invoices showing details of the car purchased under the Profit Margin Scheme. Where the car is purchased from a non-taxable person, the motor vehicle trader must issue an invoice himself stating details of the car, including at least the following information:</p><ol type='i'><li><p>the name, address and Tax Registration Number of the motor vehicle trader;</p></li><li><p>the name and address of the person selling the car;</p></li><li><p>the date of the purchase;</p></li><li><p>the details of the car;</p></li><li><p>the consideration payable for the car; and</p></li><li><p>the signature of the person selling the car or authorized signatory.</p></li></ol></li></ul></li><li><p>The motor vehicle trader must inform the FTA that it has opted to account for VAT by reference to the Profit Margin Scheme via its tax return.</p></li></ol><div class='example'><p>Example</p><p>A motor vehicle dealer, ABC LLC, provides a new car model to its Senior Vice President as a marketing initiative. As the car is available for the personal use of the Senior Vice President, ABC LLC blocks the input tax incurred on the purchase of the car from the original manufacturer.</p><p>Upon return of the car, ABC LLC can opt to sell the car under the Profit Margin Scheme since the input tax incurred on the purchase of the car was not recovered by reference to Article 53 of the Executive Regulation.</p></div></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection3.2'><h3>Instances when the Profit Margin Scheme does not apply</h3><p>As stated in the preceding paragraphs, the Profit Margin Scheme applies only when the prescribed conditions are fully satisfied. Below are two instances where the scheme does not apply &ndash; however, certain businesses have incorrectly applied the scheme in these instances:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>Cars purchased prior to the implementation of VAT</p><p>One of the conditions for the application of the Profit Margin Scheme is that the goods should have been previously subject to VAT before the supply in question. Accordingly, any stock on hand of used goods which were acquired prior to the implementation of VAT, or which have not previously been subject to VAT for other reasons, are not eligible to be sold under the Profit Margin Scheme.</p></li><li><p>Cars imported into the UAE where the VAT paid upon import has been recovered</p></li></ol><p>In accordance with Article 29 of the Executive Regulation, the Profit Margin Scheme applies to instances where goods are purchased from: (i) a person who is not a VAT registrant or, (ii) a taxable person who calculated the tax on the supply by reference to the profit margin. The scheme is also applicable where goods are purchased from a VAT registered supplier but input tax is not recovered by reference to Article 53 of the Executive Regulation</p><p>While the overseas supplier is <b>not </b>a VAT registrant in the UAE and consequently does not charge VAT on the sale, the scheme generally does not apply to scenarios where the purchase is made through import. This is because at the time of import, the importer would be able to recover the input tax. Accordingly, the sale of imported &rsquo;used&apos; cars into the UAE is not eligible for the Profit Margin Scheme. However, if the import VAT was not recovered by the importer by reference to Article 53 of the Executive Regulation, the Profit Margin Scheme will continue to remain applicable.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection4'><h3>Lease of cars</h3><p>Motor vehicle dealers or car rental companies may engage in leasing cars to residents and tourists. Depending on the requirements of the customers, the cars may be leased for long durations (i.e. on a monthly or yearly basis) or shorter durations (i.e. on a daily or weekly basis). The activity of leasing cars is a taxable supply which is subject to VAT at 5%.</p><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection4.1'><h3>VAT implications on lease of cars</h3><p>The implications relating to the date of supply, invoicing obligations and payment of tax as discussed in section 2.1 above apply similarly to the lease of cars. Where the contract for the lease of cars is for an extended period, it is expected that the contract will involve periodic payments or consecutive invoices, and therefore the date of supply will be the earliest of any of the following dates provided that it does not exceed one year from the start of the lease:</p><ul><li><p>the date of issuance of a tax invoice;</p></li><li><p>the date payment is due as shown on the tax invoice;</p></li><li><p>the date of receipt of payment.</p></li></ul></article><article id='bookmarkSection4.2'><h3>Value of supply in the case of lease of cars</h3><p>The usual rules to determine the value of supply<span>8 </span>also apply to the leasing of cars. Therefore, where the entire consideration is monetary, the value of supply is the consideration less the tax amount. In other words, the value of supply is the entire amount received or expected to be received for the lease of cars, less the tax amount.</p><p>It is observed that certain suppliers do not consider that they should account for VAT on the entire sum that they receive for the leasing of cars to VAT. It is, however, the supplier&apos;s obligation to carefully consider the different components of fees charged by them and account for VAT accordingly.</p><div class='example'><p>Example</p><p>A motor vehicle trader, XYZ LLC, leased a car to a tourist for three months. The customer regularly used one of the toll roads which resulted in salik being deducted from the vehicle&apos;s account. The lease contract stipulated that the cost of salik will be recharged by XYZ LLC to the customer.</p><p>The salik deducted from the account is essentially a cost incurred by XYZ LLC to provide car leasing services to the customer. The recharge of such a cost is subject to VAT and should be included in the taxable value of the supply.</p></div></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection5'><h3>Export of cars</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection5.1'><h3>Direct and Indirect export of cars</h3><p>Where cars are exported from the UAE, the supply may be eligible for zero-rating as an export in accordance with Article 30 of the Executive Regulation. The conditions for zero-rating vary depending on which party is contractually responsible for arranging the dispatch of goods:</p><ol><li><p>Where the motor vehicle trader is responsible for arranging the transport of sold cars from the UAE or appoints an agent to do so on its behalf (this is known as a &ldquo;direct export&rdquo;), the supply can be zero-rated if the following conditions are met:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The cars are physically exported to a place outside the Implementing States (currently, this is any country outside the UAE) or are put into a customs suspension regime in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law within 90 days of the date of the supply.</p></li><li><p>Official and commercial evidence of export or customs suspension is retained by the exporter i.e. the motor vehicle trader.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Where the &ldquo;overseas customer&rdquo; is responsible for arranging the collection of the cars from the motor vehicle trader in the UAE and then exporting the cars or has appointed an agent to do so on his behalf (this is known as an &ldquo;indirect export&rdquo;), the supply can be zero-rated if the following conditions are met:</p><ol type='a'><li><p>The cars are physically exported to a place outside the Implementing States or are put into a customs suspension regime in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law within 90 days of the date of the supply under an arrangement agreed by the motor vehicle trader and the overseas customer at or before the date of supply.</p></li><li><p>The overseas customer obtains official and commercial evidence of export or customs suspension in accordance with GCC Common Customs Law, and provides the motor vehicle trader with a copy of this.</p></li><li><p>The cars are not used or altered in the time between supply and export or customs suspension, except to the extent necessary to prepare the cars for export or customs suspension.</p></li><li><p>The goods do not leave the UAE in the possession of a passenger or crew member of an aircraft or ship. The FTA does not expect this condition to be relevant for the export of cars.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>It should be noted that one of the common conditions for zero-rating of exports is that the supplier (in the case of a direct export) or the recipient (in the case of an indirect export) must obtain official and commercial evidence of export.</p><p>Official evidence means export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department in respect of any car leaving the UAE &ndash; this would require the exporter to retain a certificate issued by the relevant Customs Department proving the exit of the car from the UAE (for example, an exit certificate or a similar document evidencing the export).</p><p>On the other hand, commercial evidence refers to a document issued by commercial parties which provides evidence of the transportation of the car to outside the UAE. Acceptable commercial evidence includes airway bills, bills of lading, consignment notes, and certificates of shipments.</p><p>The purpose of the requirements to obtain official and commercial evidence of export is to ensure that there is sufficient proof that the transaction has taken place and the car has actually left the UAE. As such, the official and commercial evidence of export must identify the following:</p><ul><li><p>the supplier;</p></li><li><p>the consignor;</p></li><li><p>the goods (i.e. car);</p></li><li><p>the value of the goods (i.e. car);</p></li><li><p>the export destination; and</p></li><li><p>the mode of transport and route of the export movement.</p></li></ul><p>Where the above conditions for zero-rating are not met, or if the car in question is not exported from the UAE or put into a customs suspension regime within the required period of 90 days, the motor vehicle trader should account for VAT on the supply at the default rate of 5%.</p><p>If an exporter is of the view that it is impossible to obtain the evidence prescribed under Article 30 of the Executive Regulation, then it may apply for an exception from the FTA. In addition, if an exporter believes that the export is not possible within 90 days from the date of supply either because the circumstances have prevented or will prevent the export within the said period or it is not practicable for the exporter to export the car within 90 days of the date of supply due to the nature of the supply, it may apply for an exception from the FTA. Please refer to VAT Administrative Exceptions Guide VATGEX1 for further details.</p><div class='example'><p>Example</p><p>ABC LLC is a motor vehicle trader established in Abu Dhabi. On a visit to the UAE for tourism purposes, Mr. X decides to purchase a car from ABC LLC. Mr. X has represented that he will self-drive the car to Oman and whilst he will be able to submit official evidence of export (i.e. exit certificate), he will not be able to furnish any commercial evidence of export because no logistics company will be appointed for transporting the car.</p><p>ABC LLC should submit a request for an administrative exception requesting the FTA to allow the use of an alternative form of evidence (instead of commercial evidence) so that the company is able to apply the zero-rating.</p></div></article><article id='bookmarkSection5.2'><h3>Multiple sale of cars resulting in single export</h3><p>It is common in the automotive sector that a single export is supported by two or more underlying sales of cars. In such instances where a single export is supported by two or more underlying supplies, only the final supply can be zero-rated.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>A Customer based in the USA orders a car from a motor vehicle trader &ldquo;X&rdquo; (based in the UAE);</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;X&rdquo; purchases the car from another motor vehicle trader &ldquo;Y&rdquo; (also based in the UAE) but does not take delivery of the car;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Y&rdquo;, at the request of &ldquo;X&rdquo;, exports the car directly to the customer in USA.</p></li></ul><p>In the above example, there are two separate underlying transactions but one export of car and accordingly the VAT treatment will be:</p><ul><li><p>The supply of the car from Y to X is a local supply in the UAE and VAT at the rate of 5% must be accounted for on this supply;</p></li><li><p>The supply of the car from X to the customer in the USA is zero-rated as an export subject to the satisfaction of the relevant conditions. It is important to note that in this example, Y is acting as an agent to export the car on behalf of X and, therefore, the export documents must demonstrate this fact clearly, for example, in the remarks section of the customs declaration.</p></li></ul></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection6'><h3>Import of cars</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection6.1'><h3>Imposition and accounting for import VAT</h3><p>Where cars are imported into the UAE from abroad, the cars will be subject to import VAT at 5%. Import VAT is imposed on the customs value as calculated pursuant to Customs legislation, including the value of insurance, freight and any customs fees paid on the import of the cars. Where the determination of such customs value is not possible, then the value can be determined based on the alternative valuation rules stated in the applicable Customs legislation.</p><p>The obligation to account for import VAT is on the &ldquo;importer&rdquo;, being the person whose name is listed as the importer of the relevant cars for customs clearance purposes. The mechanism for accounting for VAT on imported cars depends on the VAT registration status of the importer at the time of importation.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection6.2'><h3>Deferred payment at the time of filing the VAT return</h3><p>In certain situations, an importer may be able to account for VAT in the VAT return which relates to the tax period in which the cars are imported. In order for this to occur, the importer must meet the following conditions:</p><ul><li><p>the importer must be registered for VAT at the time of import;</p></li><li><p>the importer must have sufficient details for the FTA to verify the import and the VAT which is due on the import and is able to provide these as required;</p></li><li><p>the importer must have provided the FTA via the eServices portal with its own Customs registration number issued by the competent Customs department for the import in question; and</p></li><li><p>the importer must cooperate with, and comply with any rules imposed by the FTA in respect of the import.</p></li></ul><p>In practice, these conditions require a VAT-registered importer to register its Customs registration number with the FTA prior to importing cars into the UAE (this can be done at the time of registering for VAT or at a later time). When any cars are subsequently imported into the UAE by this importer using the Customs registration number which is registered with the FTA, no VAT will be charged at the time of import and the cars will be released to the importer as soon as other customs formalities are completed. The applicable import VAT would then be prepopulated as output tax in box 6 of the importer&apos;s next VAT return. It should be noted that the importer has an ongoing obligation to ensure that the VAT return reflects the correct VAT payable in respect of the import &ndash; as a consequence, the importer should review the correctness of the import VAT prepopulated in its VAT return and make corrections in box 7 of the VAT return, if necessary.</p><p>VAT incurred on imports is treated as input tax of the importer, and the importer may be able to recover it in box 10 of its VAT return, if eligible under the normal VAT recovery rules. Where the importer is entitled to recover the input tax in full, VAT will not represent a cost to the business.</p><p><u>Payment at the time of import</u></p><p>In situations where the conditions for deferring the payment of import VAT are not met &ndash; for example, the importer is not registered for VAT at the time of import &ndash; the importer would need to pay VAT to the FTA before the cars can be released to it by the relevant Customs department. This process requires the importer to use the FTA&apos;s e-Services portal to complete the VAT301 &ndash; Import Declaration Form for VAT Payment and to make the payment of applicable VAT.</p><p>Please refer to the VAT Import Declaration User Guide for detailed guidance regarding accounting for import VAT by non-registered importers.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection6.3'><h3>Import with the assistance of an import clearing agent</h3><p>Often, the task of importing goods (including cars) into the UAE and fulfilling all importation formalities is delegated to a clearing agent. For example, the task of clearing the goods through Customs may be undertaken by a specialised clearing agent, a freight forwarder responsible for delivering the goods to the purchaser, or a third-party local company.</p><p>Where a clearing agent or equivalent business is importing goods on behalf of a VAT- registered importer, the clearing agent should declare the importer&apos;s TRN on the customs import declaration. This will allow the importer to account for the import VAT in its VAT return as described in section 6.2.</p><p>On the other hand, where a clearing agent is importing goods on behalf of a non- registered importer, the agent should declare its C/O TRN on the customs import declaration and should be responsible for the payment of VAT in respect of the import in its VAT return.</p><p>It should be noted that since the clearing agent or equivalent business is not the owner of the goods, but simply facilitates the import of those goods into the UAE, it should <b>not </b>recover the import VAT as its own input tax in the VAT return, and doing so would expose the clearing agent or equivalent business to an assessment for over-recovered VAT and penalties. Instead, if the VAT is paid by the clearing agent or equivalent business, the amount can be recharged by the agent directly to the importer. To do so, the clearing agent or equivalent business must issue a statement to the importer which contains, as a minimum, the following details:</p><ul><li><p>the name, address, and TRN of the clearing agent or equivalent business;</p></li><li><p>the date on which the statement is issued;</p></li><li><p>the date of import of the relevant goods;</p></li><li><p>a description of the imported goods which is sufficient to identify them; and</p></li><li><p>the amount of VAT paid by the agent to the FTA in respect of the imported goods.</p></li></ul><p>It should be noted that the statement issued by the clearing agent is treated as a <em>de facto</em> tax invoice for VAT purposes. As a consequence, the importer is able to rely on the statement to recover VAT if and when available (for example, if the non-registered importer registers for VAT at a later date and it was eligible to recover the input tax paid before registration on such goods imported).</p><p>The FTA requires all clearing agents to retain copies of these statements, so that they are available for inspection when the FTA undertakes audits of these agents&apos; VAT accounts.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection6.4'><h3>Exceptions from import VAT</h3><p>Certain categories of goods (including cars) are relieved from import VAT. In some cases, these categories generally mirror reliefs which are available in respect of customs duties, therefore allowing certain goods not to be subject to both VAT and customs duties.</p><p><u>Import VAT suspension</u></p><p>Goods are not treated as imported into the UAE where they are under customs duty suspension arrangements in accordance with the GCC Common Customs Law under any of the following categories<span>9</span>:</p><ol><li><p>temporary admission;</p></li><li><p>goods placed in a customs warehouse;</p></li><li><p>goods in transit; or</p></li><li><p>imported goods intended to be re-exported by the same person.</p></li></ol><p>Where any of the above exceptions apply, the movement of goods into the UAE is not treated as an import, and therefore not subject to import VAT. If any conditions for the VAT suspension are subsequently broken, the goods can be treated as having been imported into the UAE and the VAT will become due on the import from the date the goods were originally imported.</p><p>In order to benefit from the above exceptions, the importer is required to provide a financial guarantee to the FTA via a clearing agent for the amount of VAT chargeable in respect of the goods. This guarantee will be refunded once the goods leave the UAE in accordance with the relevant customs suspension conditions.</p><p><u>Import VAT exemption</u></p><p>In certain situations, imports of goods into the UAE are fully exempt from VAT. The exemption applies to goods which are treated as exempt from Customs duty under any of the following categories<span>10</span>:</p><ol><li><p>goods imported by the military forces, and internal security forces;</p></li><li><p>personal effects and gifts accompanied by travelers (please note that this exemption is not relevant for import of cars);</p></li><li><p>used personal effects and household items transported by UAE nationals living abroad on return or expats moving to live in the UAE for first time (please note that this exemption is not relevant for import of cars); or</p></li><li><p>returned goods.</p></li></ol><p>The last of the above categories may apply in respect of goods which were sold and exported from the UAE, but then returned to the supplier in the UAE. It should be noted that this import exemption only covers import VAT and does not extend to VAT, if any, which may have been originally charged by the supplier on the sale of the goods.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection6.5'><h3>Purchase returns after import</h3><p>It may happen that after the importation of a car by a motor vehicle dealer, the car is returned to the overseas original manufacturer and consequently exported out of the UAE.</p><p>At the time of importation of the car, the motor vehicle dealer would have accounted for import VAT (via the deferred payment method or by making the upfront payment) and would have recovered the input tax in box 10 of the VAT return. Upon return of the car, the motor vehicle dealer should make a negative adjustment in box 7 and box 10 of the VAT return of the tax period in which the car is returned and exported out of the UAE.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection7'><h3>Warranty claims</h3><p>A warranty service is a guarantee given by a manufacturer to his customer, undertaking to remedy any defects of the car due to faulty workmanship or materials for a specified period.</p><p>Generally, a warranty service is made available to the customer at the time of sale of the car and in such instances the price for the warranty service is included in the price of the car. In other cases, the warranty service is supplied separately from the sale of the car and in such instances the price for the warranty service is charged separately.</p><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection7.1'><h3>Warranty service included in the price of car</h3><p>As stated in the preceding paragraph, in cases where the cost of the warranty is included in the price of the car, the supplier would undertake to repair any defects in the car for a specified period free of charge. In other words, the supplier would not charge any extra fees for the warranty repair services provided during the specified period.</p><p>As VAT would have already been accounted for on the original supply of the car (including on the price for the warranty), no further VAT implications will arise at the time of providing the actual repair services. It should be noted that the input tax incurred on carrying out the warranty repair services will be recoverable since it was incurred in the making of taxable supplies. This position will also apply to the sale of used cars where a motor vehicle dealer has accounted for VAT under the Profit Margin Scheme (provided the cost of warranty is included in the price of the used car).</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection7.2'><h3>Warranty service supplied for an extra charge</h3><p>A supplier may provide its customers with the option to purchase an extended warranty for a specified period. The extended warranty is provided for a separate charge and the supplier undertakes to rectify any defect in the car during the additional period and does not charge any further amount to carry out actual repair services.</p><p>The supply of an extended warranty is a taxable supply of services which is subject to VAT at 5%. The supplier accordingly needs to account for VAT on the supply of the extended warranty. The actual repair services provided during the additional period would, however, not attract VAT. This is because the VAT would have already been accounted for on the supply of extended warranty and no further implications arise at the time of providing actual repair services.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection7.3'><h3>Reimbursement of repair costs by distributors from manufacturers</h3><p>Where a distributor provides warranty services to a customer in the UAE, no VAT implications arise. This is because a distributor&apos;s warranty for no extra charge is treated as a composite supply together with the vehicle sold on which VAT has already been accounted for at the time of the original sale.</p><p>It should be noted that warranties are typically provided by the car manufacturers. Where a distributor is involved in the supply chain, the manufacturer&apos;s warranty is essentially passed on to the end customer. Such arrangements, therefore, allow the distributor to recover the costs incurred in honoring the warranty on behalf of the manufacturer.</p><p>The supply made by the distributor under a warranty arrangement with the manufacturer is a separate supply for VAT purposes. Accordingly, the VAT treatment relating to the recovery of costs relating to such supplies needs to be determined independently.</p><p>For vehicles manufactured outside the UAE, a key point to note is that the reimbursement of costs by UAE distributors from overseas manufacturers to carry out warranty repairs is subject to VAT at 5%. This is because the pre-requisite<span>11 </span>for treating the supply as a zero-rated export of service (i.e. the service must not be supplied directly in connection goods situated in the UAE) is not met.</p><div class='example'><p>Example</p><p>A Germany based manufacturer of cars, XYZ Gmbh, sells cars in the UAE through its exclusive distributor ABC LLC. Mohammad purchased a car from ABC LLC and the sales price included a 5-year warranty. On noticing some issue in the engine of the car, Mohammad took the car for a service. ABC LLC confirmed that certain parts in the engine need repair and that the service will be covered under the warranty.</p><p>Whilst ABC LLC did not charge any fees to Mohammad for repairing the engine, it recovered the cost from XYZ Gmbh. The supply made by ABC LLC to XYZ Gmbh to carry out warranty repairs is subject to VAT at 5%. The supply will not qualify for zero-rating because the services are provided directly in connection with goods (i.e. the car) situated in the UAE.</p></div></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection8'><h3>Auctions</h3><p>Motor vehicle traders may make sales of cars at auctions. Auctions are places where goods are sold to the highest bidder. Although the motor vehicle trader (hereafter referred to as an &ldquo;auctioneer&rdquo;) could be the owner / principal seller of the cars, auctions are more commonly conducted by the auctioneer acting as an agent on behalf of other persons selling their cars.</p><p>The VAT treatment of auctions depends on whether the auctioneer is acting as a principal supplier or as an agent on behalf of another person.</p><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection8.1'><h3>Auctioneer acting as the principal supplier</h3><p>In these instances, the auctioneer is, for VAT purposes, the principal supplier of the cars. This arrangement is also known as &ldquo;undisclosed agency&rdquo; where two supplies take place for VAT purposes i.e. (i) between the seller and the auctioneer; and (ii) between the auctioneer and the end customer.</p><p>As a consequence, similar to any other person making a supply of goods, the auctioneer has to consider whether or not it should charge VAT on the sale. Where the auctioneer is registered for VAT, the auctioneer must account for VAT at 5% on the supply (unless the conditions of zero rating are met on exporting the cars). Further, where the auctioneer is not registered for VAT, it must evaluate whether VAT registration obligations have arisen on account of the supply.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection8.2'><h3>Auctioneer acting as an agent of the principal supplier</h3><p>The second type of arrangement, which is more common, is when the auctioneer is not the owner / supplier of cars, but simply provides the marketplace and assistance in the process of selling the cars belonging to others through the auction. This arrangement is also known as &ldquo;disclosed agency&rdquo;.</p><p>In such situations, the auctioneer is not a principal supplier of the cars in question. Instead, the auctioneer is acting as an agent on behalf of and in the name of the owner of the cars as per Article 9(1) of the Decree-Law. As a consequence, when the cars are sold, the sale constitutes, for VAT purposes, a supply by the principal seller directly to the principal buyer &ndash; with the auctioneer being ignored for the purposes of the sale.</p><p>This means that the VAT treatment of the sale of the cars must be considered from the perspective of the principal supplier / owner of the cars. As such, depending on the facts of the sale, the supply may be either standard-rated (if the principal supplier is registered for VAT), zero-rated (if the principal supplier is registered for VAT and the car is exported from the UAE) or outside the scope of VAT (if the principal supplier is not registered and not required to register for VAT).</p><p>It should be noted that in situations where the auctioneer makes a sale of car as an agent on behalf of a principal seller, it is the obligation of the principal seller, rather than the auctioneer, to correctly comply with their tax obligations in respect of the sale. It is common for auctions that payments for the sold cars are made by the buyer to the principal supplier through the auctioneer. Where this is the case, the auctioneer would be expected to pass on the VAT charged by the principal supplier to that supplier, in order to enable the supplier to account for this VAT to the FTA.</p><p>The FTA expects the auctioneer to maintain sufficient documents to establish that the sale was made directly by the principal supplier to the customer and the auctioneer only acted as an intermediary. Such documents could include: a contract (if any) between the principal seller and the auctioneer; a copy of an invoice issued by the principal seller to the customer; the invoice issued by the auctioneer to the principal seller for his commission etc.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection8.3'><h3>Issuance of tax invoices by auctioneer on behalf of the principal supplier</h3><p>In accordance with Article 65 of the Decree-Law, where a taxable supply is made by a VAT-registered person, the taxable person must issue and deliver a valid tax invoice to the recipient of the goods or services. This requirement applies without exception for any supplies subject to VAT at 5%. Therefore, in the event that a taxable supply is made at an auction, it is a requirement that a tax invoice is both issued and delivered to the buyer of the car.</p><p>Typically, the tax invoice must be issued by the VAT-registered supplier of the car itself, in accordance with the requirements in Article 59 of the Executive Regulation. However, pursuant to Article 59(11) of the Executive Regulation, a VAT-registered agent which makes a supply on behalf of a VAT-registered principal supplier may issue their own tax invoice in respect of the supply with the particulars of the agent, as if that agent had made the supply of goods or services itself (the invoice should, however, contain a reference to the principal supplier, including the supplier&apos;s name and TRN on the invoice). If the agent does issue a tax invoice on behalf of the principal supplier under this provision, the principal supplier should not issue any other tax invoice in respect of the same supply. Furthermore, the principal supplier remains responsible for accounting for the VAT on the supply to the FTA and still must comply with all other tax obligations in respect of the supply.</p><p>The rule discussed in the preceding paragraphs may also be used by auctioneers in order to issue their own tax invoices to buyers of cars sold at an auction.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection8.4'><h3>Commission charged by auctioneers</h3><p>It is common that the auctioneer will charge a commission and/or premium to the principal supplier of a car or the buyer of a car or both. Such commission and/or premium is consideration for a taxable supply by the auctioneer of auctioning services. Where the auctioneer is registered, or required to be registered, for VAT, the auctioneer must charge VAT on such fees and account for the VAT to the FTA on its tax returns.</p><div class='example'><p>Example</p><p>Motor &amp; Motor LLC is a car trader and operates auctions of cars in the UAE. On a certain date, Motor &amp; Motor LLC sold two cars in an auction. The first car was sold by Motor &amp; Motor LLC as the principal supplier and the second car was sold as an agent of a VAT registered company, Zenith LLC.</p><p>Motor &amp; Motor LLC, being the principal supplier for the first car, is responsible for undertaking all VAT obligations relating to the sale, including issuing a tax invoice and accounting for VAT.</p><p>Zenith LLC, being the principal supplier for the second car, is responsible for undertaking all VAT obligations relating to the supply. Motor &amp; Motor LLC may issue a tax invoice on behalf of Zenith LLC in accordance with Article 59(11) of the Executive Regulation; however, the responsibility to account for VAT on the sale of the second car will still be that of Zenith LLC.</p></div></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection9'><h3>Promotions and discounts</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection9.1'><h3>Free promotional gifts</h3><p>Motor vehicle traders often offer promotional gifts with the sale of cars free of charge. This means that the motor vehicle trader does not receive any consideration for the supply of free gifts.</p><p>Where the motor vehicle trader recovers input tax on the purchase of the gift and in turn supplies such a gift free of charge, the free supply will be subject to the deemed supply <span>12</span>provisions. However, if the motor vehicle trader does not recover input tax on the purchase of the gift, the deemed supply provisions will not <span>13</span>apply.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection9.2'><h3>Discounts</h3><p>In addition to offering free gifts, motor vehicle traders also operate promotional schemes whereby they offer discounts on the sales price of the cars.</p><p>Where a motor vehicle trader funds the discount and the customers benefit from the reduction in price, VAT is applicable on the discounted value<span>14 </span>charged by the motor vehicle trader. It is important to note that the tax invoice issued by the motor vehicle trader must clearly state the discount offered to the customer in order to account for VAT on the discounted value.</p><p>Further, a motor vehicle dealer may itself receive a volume discount / bulk discount from the original manufacturer on purchasing a specified number of units. Where a volume discount is provided by the original manufacturer (for example, a discount on purchasing 100 units of a car), the manufacturer should clearly state the discount on the invoice.</p><p>In addition, a motor vehicle dealer may also receive a contingent discount or payment from the original manufacturer such as a discount on achieving a sales target or a payment upon selling a specified number of units of a particular car model. In the case of a contingent discount or payment, the parties should carefully evaluate whether the discount/payment in reality reduces the original value of the car or it is in fact consideration for a separate supply made by the motor vehicle dealer. Where the discount/payment actually reduces the original value of the car, the manufacturer should issue a credit note to reduce the value. Alternatively, if the discount/payment is received because the motor vehicle dealer has performed a specific activity, the motor vehicle dealer should issue a tax invoice and charge VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the nature of the supply.</p></article></section></article><article id='bookmarkSection10'><h3>Company cars and Demo cars</h3><section class='level-2'><article id='bookmarkSection10.1'><h3>Input tax recovery on the purchase, rent or lease of a company car</h3><p>The input tax incurred on the purchase, rent or lease of a company car is blocked<span>15 </span>if the car is available for the personal use of an employee.</p><p>Please note that the fact that a car is taken home by an employee will not of itself preclude a taxable person from recovering input tax provided the reason for this is to ensure that the vehicle is available for emergency purposes, or the nature of the job (and vehicle) is such that it requires the employee to keep the vehicle with himself/herself. The key point, however, is whether the vehicle will be available for personal purposes as well. Where the vehicle is available for personal purposes, the input tax incurred on the purchase, rent or lease of the vehicle is blocked in full.</p><p>It is important to note that where the input tax on the purchase, rent or lease of a company car is blocked, a taxable person should not recover input tax incurred on associated expenses such as insurance, maintenance, servicing etc.</p></article><article id='bookmarkSection10.2'><h3>Demo cars</h3><p>Motor vehicle traders often display demo cars in their showrooms for demonstration/ test drive purposes. As a demo car cannot be sold at the full retail value, the manufacturer may agree to make a one-off payment in respect of each demo car to compensate the trader for the lower retail value.</p><p>Where the payment made by the original manufacturer is a genuine reduction of the original sales price, such a payment will be considered as a retrospective discount. In such a case, the original manufacturer should issue a credit note to reduce the original sales price.</p><p>In contrast, if the payment relates to any obligations assumed by the motor vehicle trader to perform a specific activity (such as marketing services), the payment will be treated as consideration for a taxable supply and the motor vehicle trader will be required to issue a tax invoice and charge VAT at the appropriate rate depending on the nature of the supply.</p></article></section></article></section></main><footer><section><article><h3>Footnotes</h3><em><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback1' id='bookmark1'>[1]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-25'>Article 25</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback2' id='bookmark2'>[2]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-26'>Article 26</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback3' id='bookmark3'>[3]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-19'>Article 19</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback4' id='bookmark4'>[4]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-64'>Article 64</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback5' id='bookmark5'>[5]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-75'>Article 75</a>(4) of the Decree-Law read with <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-69'>Article 69</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback6' id='bookmark6'>[6]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-43'>Article 43</a> of the Decree-Law and <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-29'>Article 29</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback7' id='bookmark7'>[7]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-29'>Article 29</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback8' id='bookmark8'>[8]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-34'>Article 34</a> of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback9' id='bookmark9'>[9]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-47'>Article 47</a>(1) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback10' id='bookmark10'>[10]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-47'>Article 47</a>(2) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback11' id='bookmark11'>[11]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-31'>Article 31</a>(2) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback12' id='bookmark12'>[12]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-11'>Article 11</a>(1) of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback13' id='bookmark13'>[13]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-12'>Article 12</a>(1) of the Decree-Law.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback14' id='bookmark14'>[14]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-39'>Article 39</a> of the Decree-Law and <a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-28'>Article 28</a> of the Executive Regulation.</span></p><p><sup><a href='#bookmarkback15' id='bookmark15'>[15]</a></sup> <span><a href='/articles/uae-vat-article-53'>Article 53</a>(1)(b) of the Executive Regulation.</span></p></em></article></section></footer></div></body></html>"

Where a section has a narrower focus or applicability this will be identified at the outset of the chapter. Furthermore, the last chapter of this guide contains a list of key terms as defined in the VAT legislation.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection1.5><h3>Other important publications</h3><p>Occasionally we will publish other documents intended to help you further, or to promulgate useful information or a change in the way that we are approaching the administration of the affairs of taxpayers.

Occasionally it is referred to as a type of general consumption tax. In a country which has VAT, it is imposed on most supplies of goods and services that are bought and sold.</p><p>VAT is charged and collected at each stage of the supply chain by businesses which meet the requirements to be registered for VAT (see <a href=#bookmarkSection4 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 4</a> for further details). Final consumers generally bear the VAT cost while businesses collect and account for the tax.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection3.3><h3>How does VAT work?</h3><p>Businesses that are registered, or required to register, for VAT (known as 'taxable persons') charge VAT to their customers on supplies of goods or services made in the course of business. Taxable persons are then required to collect the VAT which they have charged to their customers and, on a periodic basis, pay this over to the FTA, accompanied by the submission of a tax return. More details of tax return filing and payment deadlines can be found in Chapter 11.</p><p>VAT which businesses charge to their customers is also known as 'output tax'.</p><p>Businesses will also be charged VAT by their suppliers when they acquire goods and services. In general terms, taxable persons are able to recover the VAT they are charged by their suppliers, subject to certain conditions. VAT which is incurred on expenses is also known as 'input tax'.</p><p>Where the conditions to allow recovery of input tax are met, the taxable person is able to deduct the input tax recoverable from the value of output tax it is due to pay. This results in the net VAT payable to the FTA in each tax return period.</p><p>Persons which are not entitled to register for VAT are not able to recover any VAT they incur, except in certain specified cases. As a result, incurred VAT becomes a cost to the final consumer.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 1</h3><p>A furniture manufacturer purchases wood from a forester, which it uses to produce furniture. This furniture is sold to a private customer.</p><p>The furniture manufacturer purchases wood from the forester for AED 10,000 + VAT at 5%. The manufacturer pays the forester AED 10,500 in total, AED 500 of which is input tax.</p><p>The furniture manufacturer then sells furniture to the individual customer for AED 30,000 + VAT at 5%. The manufacturer receives a total payment of AED 31,500 from the customer, of which AED 1,500 is output tax.</p><p>When the furniture manufacturer completes their tax return for the period, they must declare output tax of AED 1,500 to the FTA. However, they are entitled to deduct the AED 500 of input tax incurred on purchases. This means that the net VAT payable to the FTA is AED 1,000.</p><p>The individual customer is not entitled to recover the AED 1,500 charged by the furniture manufacturer. Therefore the cost of the VAT is borne by the customer.</p><p>The image below depicts a typical supply chain.</p></div><img src=https://gtlcdnstorage.blob.core.windows.net/guide/uae/vat/VATG001/01.webp alt='Illustration of VAT collection process showing cotton farming, garment manufacturing, retail selling, and final consumer purchase, demonstrating VAT charged and recovered at each stage, with the consumer ultimately bearing the total VAT cost.'></article><article id=bookmarkSection3.4><h3>UAE VAT rates</h3><p>There will be two VAT rates applicable within the UAE:</p><ul><li><p>the standard rate of VAT – 5%; and</p></li><li><p>the zero rate of VAT – 0%.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, a certain category of supplies will be 'exempt' from VAT.</p><p>Although VAT is not accounted for in respect of both zero-rated and exempt supplies, there is an important distinction between the two.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection3.4.1><h3>Zero-rated supplies</h3><p>VAT is not accounted for on zero-rated supplies (since the applicable rate is 0%), but such supplies are still treated as 'taxable supplies' in all other respects. As a result, the person making the supply has the right to recover the VAT incurred on their own business expenditure in the same way as they would if they made standard-rated supplies.</p><p>A full list of zero-rated supplies is included in <a href=#bookmarkSection6 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 6</a>.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection3.4.2><h3>Exempt supplies</h3><p>Similar to zero-rated supplies, no VAT is collected in respect of exempt supplies. However, since those supplies are not 'taxable supplies', the supplier cannot normally recover any of the VAT on expenses incurred in making exempt supplies.</p><p>Incurred VAT therefore will represent a cost to businesses involved in making supplies which are wholly or partly exempt from VAT.</p><p>A full list of exempt supplies is included in <a href=#bookmarkSection6 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 6</a>.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection3.5><h3>Adding VAT to goods and services</h3><p>VAT is charged on the value of goods and services.</p><p>When adding VAT to the price of goods or services, the business should multiply the amount by the applicable VAT rate (e.g. 5%).</p><p>If the price already includes VAT, divide the price by 21 (for the 5% VAT rate) to find out the VAT amount. Subtracting this amount from the VAT-inclusive price, will give the VAT-exclusive value of the supply.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection4><h3>Registration</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection4.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of who needs to register for VAT, the tests which apply to determine when a business must register for VAT and the process to follow to become VAT registered.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.2><h3>Why registration is important?</h3><p>VAT is a transaction based tax which is imposed on most supplies of goods and services. However, the obligation to charge VAT only extends to persons who are registered for VAT or are required to register for VAT. These persons are known as 'taxable persons'. A taxable person who is registered for VAT receives a tax registration number ('TRN') and is referred to as a 'registrant'.</p><p>It should be noted that the definition of a 'person' is very wide and includes any legal or natural person. As such, all types of persons – including individuals, companies, partnerships, clubs, associations, and so forth – may be able, or be required, to register for VAT and charge tax on their supplies.</p><p>In addition to the obligation to charge VAT on applicable supplies, taxable persons may also be able to recover VAT incurred on their expenses. This ensures that in the majority of situations, VAT is not a cost to registered businesses.</p><p>A person may either be required to register mandatorily, or may do so voluntarily. In addition, two or more legal persons may be registered as a tax group under a single VAT registration.</p><p>These options are discussed below.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.3><h3>Mandatory registration</h3><p>If a person is resident in the UAE or any other GCC state that has implemented VAT in accordance with the Common VAT Agreement of the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the person is required to register for VAT if:</p><ul><li><p>the total value of their taxable supplies and imports made within the UAE exceeds the Mandatory Registration Threshold of AED 375,000 over the previous 12-month period; or</p></li><li><p>the person anticipates that the total value of their taxable supplies or imports will exceed AED 375,000 in the next 30 days.</p></li></ul><p>This means that businesses must monitor the value of their supplies and imports on an ongoing basis to understand whether they are required to register for VAT.</p><p>If the person is not a resident in any GCC country that has implemented VAT, they may be required to register for VAT if the person makes any taxable supplies or imports in the UAE, unless there is another person in the UAE who is responsible for accounting for VAT on such activities.</p><p>The main categories of supplies and imports that need to be taken into account for the purposes of VAT registration thresholds are:</p><ol><li><p>Supplies of goods or services made in the UAE in the course of business.</p></li><li><p>Any goods or services that the person has imported into the UAE that would have been subject to VAT had they been supplied in the UAE.</p></li></ol><p>The person should not include the value of any supplies which are exempt from VAT in this calculation.</p><p>The person should also not include the value of any one-off supply of a capital asset when calculating the total value of taxable supplies for VAT registration purposes.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 2</h3><p>On 15 January, ABC LLC, a business resident in the UAE, made AED 275,000 of taxable supplies and AED 135,000 of exempt supplies in the previous 12- month period.</p><p>Since the total value of their taxable supplies is less than the Mandatory Registration Threshold, they would not be obliged to become VAT registered.</p><p>On 20 January ABC LLC sold additional AED 200,000 of taxable supplies. As the combined value of their taxable supplies in the previous 12-month period exceeds the Mandatory Registration Threshold, ABC LLC is required to register for VAT.</p><p>ABC LLC exceeds the Mandatory Registration Threshold of AED 375,000 and they would be required to notify the FTA of their requirement to register for VAT.</p></div></article><div class=example><h3>Example 3</h3><p>On 1 March, XYZ LLC, a business resident in the UAE, is not required to register for VAT since the value of their supplies and imports over the previous 12-month period does not exceed the registration threshold. On 1 March, they enter into a contract to provide AED 5,000,000 of taxable supplies on 15 March.</p><p>As XYZ LLC expects to receive supplies in excess of the Mandatory Registration Threshold within the next 30 days, they have an obligation to notify the FTA of their requirement to register for VAT.</p></div><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection4.3.1><h3>What is a 'place of residence'?</h3><p>As mentioned above, the registration requirements differ depending on whether or not the person is resident in the GCC Implementing States.</p><p>A person may be resident in a country if:</p><ol><li><p>the business is legally established in the country;</p></li><li><p>the business's significant management decisions are taken, and central management functions conducted in the country; or</p></li><li><p>the business has a fixed place of business in the country through which it regularly or permanently conducts business and where sufficient level of human and technology resource exist to enable the supply or receipt of goods and services (e.g. a branch).</p></li></ol></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.3.2><h3>When to register for VAT</h3><p>If a person has made taxable supplies with a value exceeding the Mandatory Registration Threshold over the previous 12 months, the person must notify the FTA within 30 days of exceeding the threshold. The VAT registration will take effect from the start of the month following the month in which the person is required to register.</p><p>If a person anticipates making taxable supplies with a value exceeding the Mandatory Registration Threshold in the next 30 days, the person must notify the FTA that they are required to be registered within 30 days starting on the date that the expectation arises. The VAT registration will take effect from the day on which the person had reasonable grounds for believing that they would exceed the Mandatory Registration Threshold.</p><p>Finally, if the person is not a resident of the GCC Implementing States and they are required to register for VAT, the registration will be effective from the date on which the person started making supplies in the UAE.</p><p>In all of the above situations, the FTA may agree that the registration is effective from an earlier date.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 4</h3><p>On 1 June, a person exceeds the Mandatory Registration Threshold for the prior 12 month period. The person must inform the FTA that they are required to be registered by 30 June. The VAT registration will take effect from 1 July.</p></div></article><div class=example><h3>Example 5</h3><p>A person enters into an agreement on 15 August to supply taxable goods worth AED 400,000 to a customer on 1 September. The person must notify the FTA that they are required to be registered by 13 September. The VAT registration will take effect from 15 August.</p></div><article id=bookmarkSection4.3.3><h3>Exceptions from registration</h3><p>If a person exceeds, or anticipates exceeding, the Mandatory Registration Threshold, they may request to be excluded from the requirement to register if their taxable supplies are exclusively zero-rated. However, the FTA is not obliged to accept such requests and acceptance is at the FTA's discretion.</p><p>If a request for exception from registration is accepted, then the person must inform the FTA if they start making any supplies which are subject to VAT at the standard rate. A failure to do so could result in the FTA raising a tax assessment and imposing penalties.</p></article></section><article id=bookmarkSection4.4><h3>Voluntary registration</h3><p>Voluntary registration is an option available to businesses which do not have a turnover in excess of the Mandatory Registration Threshold but would still like to be registered for VAT. There are a number of reasons why a business may choose to voluntarily register for VAT, for example:</p><ul><li><p>to be able to recover VAT on their expenses;</p></li><li><p>to ensure that any incurred VAT does not become embedded in their pricing, therefore forcing the business to increase prices because they cannot recover the VAT incurred; and</p></li><li><p>to obtain the TRN to obtain cash flow advantages when purchasing goods from outside the UAE (by being able to use the reverse charge).</p></li></ul><p>A person can voluntarily register for VAT if:</p><ul><li><p>at the end of any month, the total value of the person's taxable supplies and imports, or their expenses which were subject to VAT, in the previous 12 months exceeds the Voluntary Registration Threshold of AED 187,500; or</p></li><li><p>the total value of the person's taxable supplies and imports, or their expenses which are subject to VAT, in the next 30 days is expected to exceed the Voluntary Registration Threshold of AED 187,500.</p></li></ul><p>A voluntary registration is effective from the first day of the month following the month in which the application is made, or from such earlier date as may be requested by the person and agreed by the FTA.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 6</h3><p>XYZ LLC is setting up in business as a sports shoe retailer. They have not yet begun trading but are in the process of fitting out the retail premises and purchasing stock prior to the opening of their first store. They begin incurring costs on 1 February and intend to begin trading on 1 April.</p><p>They expect to incur VAT-bearing costs of AED 200,000 prior to starting business on 1 April and therefore may apply to be voluntarily registered.</p><p>As XYZ LLC's expected taxable expenditure in the following 30 days will exceed the Voluntary Registration Threshold, they may apply to be registered for VAT.</p></div></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.5><h3>Tax groups</h3><p>Two or more persons carrying on a business are able to apply for a single tax group registration, and therefore be treated as a single taxable person by the FTA. In order to be a tax group:</p><ul><li><p>each member of the Group must be a legal person (that is, not a natural person);</p></li><li><p>each member must have a place of establishment or a fixed establishment in the UAE;</p></li><li><p>the members must be related parties; and</p></li><li><p>one or more persons conducting business in a partnership must control the others.</p></li></ul><p>As seen from the above conditions, each member must be related to the other to a sufficient extent. In this context, 'related' is taken to mean they share economic, financial and organisational ties (either in law, shareholding or voting rights). One person must be able to control the members. For further information regarding tax group eligibility criteria, please refer to the Tax Groups VAT Guide (VATG101).</p><p>The effect of a tax group registration is that the members of the tax group are treated as a single taxable person for VAT purposes. This means that:</p><ul><li><p>supplies made between members of the tax group will be disregarded for VAT purposes and therefore no VAT is chargeable on intra-group transactions;</p></li><li><p>only one VAT Tax Registration Number is issued for use by the group;</p></li><li><p>the tax group submits only one tax return which summarises all supplies and purchases made by group members over the tax period concerned; and</p></li><li><p>one member of the tax group will be appointed as its 'representative member'. All of the VAT obligations of the tax group, and all supplies made and received by it, are carried out in the name of the representative member.</p></li></ul><p>Please note that the members of a tax group are jointly and severally liable for any and all VAT debts and other such obligations of the group for the period during which they were members. That means that even when a business has left a tax group, they remain liable for VAT and penalties for the period of membership.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.6><h3>How to register for VAT</h3><p>The VAT registration form and tax group registration form are available via the online portal on the FTA website. This can be completed by the taxable person or their appointed tax agent.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.7><h3>Failure to notify of the requirement to register</h3><p>If a taxable person fails to notify the FTA of a requirement to register for VAT within the specified timeframe, the FTA may register the person from the date they were required to be registered. The taxable person will remain liable for any VAT due to be accounted for on taxable supplies made since the effective date of the registration, and will be subject to applicable penalties.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.8><h3>Deregistration</h3><p>A taxable person must notify the FTA of the requirement to deregister within 20 business days from the end of the month in which any of the following occurs:</p><ul><li><p>the taxable person ceases making taxable supplies; or</p></li><li><p>the value of the taxable person's taxable supplies in the preceding 12 calendar months is less than the Voluntary Registration Threshold.</p></li></ul><p>The FTA will deregister the taxable person if they are satisfied that:</p><ul><li><p>the taxable person no longer makes taxable supplies and does not intend to make any taxable supplies in the next 12 months; or</p></li><li><p>the value of the taxable person's taxable supplies or taxable expenses over the previous 12 month period is less than the Voluntary Registration Threshold and the taxable person does not anticipate making taxable supplies or incur taxable expenses in excess of the Voluntary Registration Threshold in the next 30 days.</p></li></ul><p>The taxable person will be deregistered with effect from the last day of the tax period during which they met the conditions for deregistration, or from any other date as may be determined by the FTA. In order to be deregistered the person must be up to date with their tax returns and associated payments.</p><p>Where a taxable person is not required to deregister, the person may apply for a voluntary deregistration if the total value of their taxable supplies in the previous 12 months was less than the Mandatory Registration Threshold. However, if the person has voluntarily registered for VAT, voluntary deregistration will not be possible until 12 months have elapsed since the date of registration.</p><p>Requests for deregistration should be made via the online portal available on the FTA website.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection4.9><h3>Failure to notify of the requirement to deregister</h3><p>A person may be subject to an administrative penalty if they fail to deregister within the timeframes specified above.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection5><h3>Taxable Supplies</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection5.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>Most business transactions involve supplies of goods or services.</p><p>Where a taxable person makes a 'taxable supply' of goods and/or services, it will typically be required to account for VAT to the FTA (if the supply is subject to the standard rate of VAT).</p><p>This chapter will consider a number of issues related to taxable supplies, in particular the following:</p><ul><li><p>what types of supplies are taxable supplies;</p></li><li><p>the cases where a taxable supply is deemed to take place; and</p></li><li><p>the distinction between a single composite supply and multiple supplies.</p></li></ul></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.2><h3>What is a taxable supply?</h3><p>A taxable supply is defined in the VAT legislation as a 'supply of goods or services for a consideration by a person conducting business in the UAE, and does not include an exempt supply'. As a consequence, for a supply to be a taxable supply, the following conditions would generally need to be met:</p><ul><li><p>there needs to be supply of goods or services;</p></li><li><p>the supply has to be for consideration; and</p></li><li><p>the supply has to be made by the person who is conducting business in the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>Taxable supplies may either be subject to the standard rate or zero rate of VAT. A supply cannot be a taxable supply if it is an exempt supply. Where a supply is neither a taxable supply nor an exempt supply, it will be outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection5.2.1><h3>A supply of 'goods and services'</h3><p>As a first step, it is necessary to establish whether a person is supplying goods or services. This determination is important because some VAT rules apply differently to goods and services – for example, the date of supply and the place of supply rules.</p><p>Broadly, a supply will be of goods if there is a transfer of the ownership of any property or assets, or the transfer or granting of the right to use the property or assets as the owner. Some supplies are expressly treated in the legislation as a supply of goods – for example, a supply of water, energy or real estate will be treated as a supply of goods.</p><p>A supply of services is the supply of anything other than a supply of goods.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.2.2><h3>A supply has to be for 'consideration'</h3><p>For a taxable supply to exist, the supply must be made in return for consideration. 'Consideration' is a defined term in the VAT legislation and includes anything that is received or expected to be received for the supply of goods or services, whether in money or other forms of payment.</p><p>As a consequence, the supplier of any goods and services has to carefully consider what it receives in return for any supply made by it. In doing so, the supplier should not only consider any monetary benefit being received, but also any goods or services that that it may be receiving in exchange.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.2.3><h3>A supply has to be by a person conducting business in the UAE</h3><p>The next requirement for a taxable supply is that the supply has to be made by the person who is conducting business in the UAE.</p><p>It is important to understand the difference between business and non-business activities. The definition of 'business' is very broad and includes any regular or ongoing activity conducted independently by a person. As such, a person may be conducting business irrespective of the industry or location of the activities, as long as the activity has a degree of independence and recurrence or continuity.</p><p>Due to the requirement that a business must be an independent activity, activities of employees will not be treated as being in the course of business. As such, employees will not charge VAT in respect of their employment. In contrast, activities of independent contractors would be in the course of business and therefore can give rise to the requirement to charge VAT.</p><p>The second part of the test is that the business has to be conducted in the UAE. For VAT purposes, this requirement will be met if the place of supply is in the UAE. Please refer to <a href=#bookmarkSection7 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 7</a> regarding the place of supply rules.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.3><h3>Deemed supplies</h3><p>Typically, VAT is charged on a taxable supply. As discussed above, for a taxable supply to exist, a number of conditions have to be met.</p><p>Sometimes, an activity may take place which does not satisfy the requirements of a taxable supply. For example, a person may do something with the goods which does not involve making them available to another party, or goods or services may be provided to another person without any consideration.</p><p>To ensure that VAT rules are not circumvented by conducting activities in a manner which would not give rise to a taxable supply, the VAT legislation deems a supply to take place in certain situations. These are known as 'deemed supplies'.</p><p>Where a deemed supply takes place, a taxable person may be required to account for VAT as though they have made a taxable supply of goods or services.</p><p>There are a number of situations that give rise to a deemed supply:</p><ol><li><p>Where a taxable person supplies goods or services which formed part of their assets for no consideration.</p></li><li><p>Where a taxable person transfers goods that form part of their business assets from the UAE to another GCC Implementing State, or from the taxable person's business in another GCC Implementing State to the UAE, unless:</p><ul><li><p>the transfer is treated as a temporary transfer in accordance with the Customs legislation; or</p></li><li><p>the transfer is made as part of another taxable supply of these goods.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Where a taxable person deducts input tax in respect of goods or services but then uses them for non-business purposes.</p></li><li><p>Where a person deregistered from VAT, there is a deemed supply of goods and services that the person owns at the date of deregistration.</p></li></ol><p>The above rules mean, for example, that gifts or the private use of business assets may give rise to a liability to account for VAT.</p><p>It should be noted that there are a number of exceptions that prevent the deemed supply rules from being triggered. For example, there will be no deemed supply in respect of any goods or services if no input tax was ever recovered in respect of those goods and services, or where the supply would be an exempt supply (e.g. a supply of a residential building). Furthermore, no deemed supply will exist where the value of the supply of goods (e.g. gifts) for each recipient does not exceed AED 500 within a 12-month period, or where the total of output tax which would be payable by a person on all deemed supplies made by them is less than AED 2,000 for a 12-month period.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 7</h3><p>A furniture distributor purchases a dining table with the intention of selling it on to a customer. The distributor is charged VAT on the purchase of the dining table, which they recover as input tax.</p><p>At a later date, the furniture distributor decides to give the dining table away to a staff member for free in recognition of good service from the member of staff. This is a deemed supply and the distributor is required to account for output tax on the deemed value of the supply and pay the output tax over to the FTA.</p></div></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.4><h3>Multiple supplies versus a simple composite supply</h3><p>In some situations, a supplier may make a supply of a number of goods and services as part of the same transaction.</p><p>Where there is such a supply of different goods and/or services, the supplier has to determine whether they are making a single composite supply of those goods and/or services, or multiple supplies of goods and/or services.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection5.4.1><h3>Multiple supplies</h3><p>Where a person makes multiple supplies, the person must determine the correct VAT treatment of each of the supplies that it makes.</p><p>This means that potentially different supplies made as part of the same transaction can be subject to different VAT treatments. In such circumstances, where a single consideration was paid for multiple supplies that are subject to different VAT rates, the supplier must determine the value of each supply and apply the correct VAT treatment to that value.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 8</h3><p>A tourist visitor from the UK is booking a hotel room in Dubai using the hotel's website for AED 1,000. While booking the room, the person added an optional extra of being picked up by the hotel from the airport. This optional airport pick-up costs an additional AED 150.</p><p>The hotel accommodation and the transportation service are two different supplies for VAT purposes. These services are clearly independent of each other and both are subject to separate charges.</p><p>As a consequence, the hotel charges VAT on the hotel room at 5% and treats the airport pick-up service as an exempt local transportation service.</p></div></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.4.2><h3>A single composite supply</h3><p>A single composite supply is a single indivisible supply of a mixture of goods and/or services. By being treated as a single supply, all of the goods and/or services which form part of the supply will be subject to the same VAT treatment. A single composite supply may exist, for example, where there is a principal component and incidental components in a supply for which a single price is payable.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 9</h3><p>An airline provides free access to a lounge for all business class passengers on international flights.</p><p>Since the lounge access is incidental to the provision of the supply of the international flight, both components will be treated as a single composite supply subject to VAT at 0%.</p></div></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection5.5><h3>Service charges and tips</h3><p>If a person charges a service charge to their customers, it is further consideration for the principal supply (e.g. catering services) and follows the same VAT liability as that supply. If the customer, however, freely gives a tip over and above the total charge, no VAT is due on the tip and it is outside the scope of VAT.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection6><h3>Zero-rated and exempt supplies</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection6.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>The purpose of this chapter is to give an overview of the supplies which will be subject to VAT at the zero rate and supplies which will be exempt from VAT. More detailed Guides will be provided separately on some of the areas below.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection6.2><h3>Zero-rated supplies</h3><p>Zero-rated supplies are taxable supplies of goods or services which are subject to VAT at 0%. The following broad categories of supplies are zero-rated:</p><ul><li><p>A direct or indirect export of goods or services to outside the GCC Implementing States.</p></li><li><p>International transport of passengers and goods which starts or ends in the UAE or passes through the UAE's territory, including services related to such transport.</p></li><li><p>Goods and services consumed or used during the international transportation of goods or passengers.</p></li><li><p>Air, sea and land means of transport intended for the transportation of passengers or goods, and goods and services supplied for the purpose of the operation, repair, maintenance or conversion of these means of transport.</p></li><li><p>Aircraft or vessels designated for rescue and assistance by air or sea.</p></li><li><p>Certain investment precious metals.</p></li><li><p>The first supply of a newly constructed or converted residential building within 3 years of the completion of the construction or conversion.</p></li><li><p>The first supply of a building specifically designed to be used by charities.</p></li><li><p>Crude oil and natural gas.</p></li><li><p>Educational services and related goods and services for nurseries, preschool, and elementary education; and higher educational institutions owned or funded by Federal or local Government.</p></li><li><p>Preventive and basic healthcare services and related goods and services.</p></li></ul><p>As mentioned above, although VAT charged on a zero-rated supply is nil, the supply is still treated as a taxable supply in all other respects – including the right of the person making the supply to recover the VAT on expenses incurred in making the zero-rated supply.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection6.3><h3>Exempt supplies</h3><p>The following supplies are exempt from VAT:</p><ul><li><p>Financial services which are not conducted for an explicit fee, discount, commission, rebate or similar type of consideration, including life insurance and reinsurance of life insurance.</p></li><li><p>Residential buildings, other than the residential buildings which are specifically zero-rated.</p></li><li><p>Bare land.</p></li><li><p>Local passenger transport.</p></li></ul><p>Exempt supplies are not taxable supplies for VAT purposes. Therefore, VAT is not charged on exempt supplies and the supplier is prevented from recovering any VAT on expenses incurred in making those exempt supplies.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection7><h3>Place of supply</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection7.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>A taxable supply needs to take place in the UAE in order to fall within the scope of UAE VAT. If a supply takes place outside the UAE, the supply is treated as outside the scope of UAE VAT and therefore UAE VAT will not apply.</p><p>In order to assist businesses in determining where a supply takes place, the VAT legislation provides a number of 'place of supply' rules. These rules are different for goods and services, and may vary depending on a set of specific facts. Therefore, businesses need to familiarize themselves with the rules to ensure that the VAT is accounted for in the correct jurisdiction.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection7.2><h3>Goods</h3><p>For goods, the basic rule is that if the goods are located in the UAE when supplied, then they are treated as supplied in the UAE. Similarly, if the goods are located outside the UAE when they are supplied, the place of supply is outside the UAE.</p><p>The rules are, however, modified when the supply of goods involves transportation, or installation or assembly of the goods. The table below provides an overview of the special place of supply rules for goods.</p><table><tr><th>Where</th><th>Then the supply takes place</th></tr><tr><td>…the supply is of installed or assembled goods…</td><td>…in the place where the assembly or installation of goods takes place.</td></tr><tr><td>…the supply involves export of goods from the UAE to a place outside the GCC Implementing States…</td><td>…in the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>…the supply involves export of goods from one GCC Implementing State to another GCC Implementing State to a recipient resident in that second Implementing State and the following conditions are met:</td><td>…in the supplier's Implementing State.<ul><li>the recipient is <u>not</u> registered for VAT or liable to be registered for VAT in their State; and</li><li>the total value of exports by the supplier to the recipient's Implementing State does not exceed the mandatory registration threshold in the State of the recipient…</li></ul></td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Where</th><th>Then the supply takes place</th></tr><tr><td>…the supply involves export of goods from one GCC Implementing State to another GCC Implementing State to a recipient resident in that second Implementing State and the following conditions are met:</td><td>…in the recipient's Implementing State.<ul><li>the recipient is <u>not</u> registered for VAT or liable to be registered for VAT in their State; and</li><li>the total value of exports by the supplier to the recipient's Implementing State does not exceed the mandatory registration threshold in the State of the recipient…</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>…the supply involves export of goods from one GCC Implementing State to another GCC Implementing State to a recipient who is registered for VAT in the second Implementing State…</td><td>…in the recipient's Implementing State.</td></tr><tr><td>…the supply is of water or energy through a distribution system by a taxable person who is resident in the UAE to a taxable person resident in another GCC Implementing States whose main activity is the distribution of water or energy…</td><td>…in the place where the recipient has their place of residence.</td></tr><tr><td>…the supply is of water or energy through a distribution system by a taxable person to a person who is not a taxable person…</td><td>…in the place of actual consumption.</td></tr></table><ul><li>the recipient is <u>not</u> registered for VAT or liable to be registered for VAT in their state; and</li><li>the total value of exports by the supplier to the recipient's Implementing State exceeds the mandatory registration threshold in the State of the recipient…</li></ul><p>It should be noted that there is no special place of supply rule for goods imported into the UAE from outside the GCC Implementing States. Such imports will be subject to UAE VAT on importation. Please refer to <a href=#bookmarkSection9 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 9</a> for more information regarding imports.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection7.3><h3>Services</h3><p>The default rule for the place of supply of services is that services are deemed to take place where the supplier has their place of residence.</p><p>Where the supplier has multiple potential places of residence (e.g. the business is incorporated in one country and has branches in other countries) the place of residence will be the place that is most closely connected with the supply being made. For example, where a UAE branch of a UK company provides services under the contract signed by the branch, the supply will be most closely connected with the UAE.</p><p>There are a number of exceptions to the default place of supply rule for services:</p><table><tr><th>Where</th><th>Then the supply takes place</th></tr><tr><td>…services are supplied by a supplier who is resident in one GCC Implementing State to a recipient who is resident in another GCC Implementing State and the recipient is registered for VAT in the second Implementing State…</td><td>…in the recipient's Implementing State.</td></tr><tr><td>…services are supplied by a supplier who is resident outside the GCC Implementing States to a business recipient who is resident in the UAE…</td><td>…in the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>…services are supplied that relate to goods, such as the installation of goods…</td><td>…where the services are performed.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is supply of a means of transport to a lessee who is not a taxable person in the UAE and is not registered for VAT in any GCC Implementing State…</td><td>…where the means of transport are placed at the disposal of the lessee.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is a supply of restaurant, hotel, and catering services…</td><td>…where the services are performed.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is a supply of any cultural, artistic, sporting, educational or similar services…</td><td>…where the services are performed.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is a supply of services related to real estate…</td><td>…where the real estate is located.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is a supply of transportation services…</td><td>…where the transportation starts.</td></tr><tr><td>…there is a supply of telecommunications services or electronic services…</td><td>…where the use and enjoyment takes place, to the extent of such use and enjoyment.</td></tr></table></article><article id=bookmarkSection7.4><h3>Reverse charge mechanism</h3><p>In certain situations a non-resident supplier of goods or services may be treated as making a supply in the UAE. As a consequence, the non-resident may be required to register for VAT and charge UAE VAT.</p><p>The 'reverse charge mechanism' is a simplification measure to avoid the need for non-resident suppliers who are resident outside the UAE to register for VAT when they make a supply of goods or services in the UAE to registered persons.</p><p>Where the reverse charge mechanism applies, the non-resident supplier will not charge VAT to the recipient. Instead, the recipient must self-account for the VAT in respect of the goods and services received. This means that the recipient must record the VAT on the acquisition as output tax at the applicable rate in their system and declare it in their VAT return. It should be noted that this 'self-accounted' VAT may be able to be recovered by the recipient as input tax in accordance with the normal input tax recovery rules (see <a href=#bookmarkSection10 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 10</a>).</p><p>The reverse charge mechanism applies where:</p><ul><li>the place of supply is in the UAE;</li><li>the supply would be subject to VAT in the UAE;</li><li>the supplier's place of residence is outside the UAE;</li><li>the recipient's place of residence is in the UAE; and</li><li>the recipient is VAT registered in the UAE.</li></ul><p>In addition to the conditions set out above, the reverse charge mechanism also applies where a registered person imports goods from outside the UAE. Please see <a href=#bookmarkSection9 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 9</a> on imports for more information.</p><p>The purpose of the reverse charge mechanism is to reduce compliance and the administrative burden of collecting VAT from non-resident suppliers. Furthermore, it puts the recipient in the same position as they would have been if they acquired the goods or services from a domestic supplier, thereby ensuring that domestic UAE suppliers are not disadvantaged by VAT not being collected from purchases from abroad.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 10</h3><p>XYZ LLC is a VAT registered business in the UAE. They purchase consultancy services from a law firm located in the UK for AED 30,000.</p><p>The UK supplier will not charge UK VAT to XYZ LLC but will issue an invoice for AED 30,000.</p><p>Since the place of supply is in the UAE and the consultancy services would be subject to UAE VAT at 5%, XYZ LLC must calculate the VAT due on the acquired services (AED 30,000 x 5% = AED 1,500). This VAT must be declared by XYZ LLC as output tax in their tax return, as if they had made the supply themselves.</p><p>XYZ LLC can also consider whether or not they can recover this VAT incurred as input tax in accordance with the normal VAT recovery rules.</p></div></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection8><h3>Date of supply</h3><section class=level-2><article><p>The date of supply (also known as the 'time of supply' or a 'tax point') rules dictate the time when the liability to charge and account for VAT arises in respect of any supply of goods and services.</p><p>The rules differ between a supply of goods and a supply of services.</p><table><tr><th>If a person supplies</th><th>The date of supply is the earlier of the date of:</th></tr><tr><td>Goods…</td><td><ul><li>transfer, if goods are transferred under the supervision of the supplier;</li><li>the recipient taking possession of the goods, if transfer is not under the supervision of the supplier;</li><li>assembly or installation being completed (if applicable);</li><li>import, where the goods arrive from outside the UAE;</li><li>the recipient's acceptance of the supply or a date no later than 12 months after the date on which the goods were transferred or placed at the client's disposal if the supply was on a returnable basis;</li><li>receipt of payment; or</li><li>issue of a tax invoice.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Services…</td><td><ul><li>completion of the service;</li><li>receipt of payment; or</li><li>issue of a tax invoice.</li></ul></td></tr></table><div class=example><h3>Example 11</h3><p>ABC Co. sells goods to BCD Co. and the following events occur:</p><ul><li>ABC Co. raises a tax invoice for the sale of the goods on 14 March;</li><li>ABC Co. delivers the goods to BCD Co's premises on 1 April;</li><li>BCD Co. pays for the goods on 2 April.</li></ul><p>The date of supply for the sale of the goods is 14 March as this is the earlier of the events which trigger the time of supply.

This means that no import VAT will be due in respect of goods which would ordinarily be zero-rated or exempt from VAT.</p><p>The manner in which this import VAT should be paid, and the timing of payment, is dependent on the status of the importer.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection9.2.1><h3>Imports made by non-registered persons</h3><p>Where the import is made by an individual or a business which is not registered for VAT in the UAE, VAT is due to be paid in respect of the import at the point of importation. As such, VAT must be paid prior to the goods being released to the importer.</p><p>Import VAT is calculated on the value of the goods inclusive of any customs duty and excise tax that may also be due. Payment of VAT will need to be made directly to the FTA, separately from any payments which are due to the Customs authorities (for example, customs duties). VAT payment will be made to the FTA using the FTA's payment portal. Once the VAT is paid, the importer will be able to proceed with the customs clearing process in respect of the goods.</p><p>It should be noted that where an unregistered person imports goods using a VAT- registered agent, such as a courier company, the agent will be responsible for paying import VAT to the FTA on behalf of the unregistered person. This agent needs to account for the relevant import VAT on their own tax return, and is not able to recover the VAT accounted for as input tax. The agent will also be required to issue a statement to the unregistered importer with details of the import and the VAT paid.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection9.2.2><h3>Imports made by VAT registered persons</h3><p>Where the import is made by a VAT registered person, the import VAT should be accounted for on the person's tax return using the reverse charge mechanism. As a consequence, a VAT registered person may clear the goods through customs and be able to use the goods in the UAE even before the import VAT is accounted for to the FTA.</p><p>In order to benefit from the ability to defer the payment of VAT in this way, the importer must:</p><ul><li>be able to demonstrate that they are registered for VAT at the time of import of the goods;</li><li>provide the FTA with their own Customs registration number issued by the competent Customs authority for that import; and</li><li>co-operate with the FTA and comply with any other rules which may be imposed by the FTA in respect of the import.</li></ul><p>Where the payment of the import VAT is accounted for on the tax return, the VAT registered importer must declare the import VAT as output tax in the tax return covering the period of importation.</p><p>Where permitted under the normal VAT recovery rules, the importer may also recover the import VAT incurred as input tax in their tax return. Where the business is entitled to recover the input tax in full, this import VAT will not represent a cost to the business.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection9.3><h3>Relief from import VAT</h3><p>Certain categories of goods are relieved from import VAT. In some cases, these categories mirror reliefs which are available in respect of customs duties, therefore allowing certain goods not to be subject to both VAT and customs duties.</p><p>Import VAT relief will be available in the cases outlined below.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection9.3.1><h3>Customs suspension</h3><p>Where goods are under customs duty suspension arrangements in accordance with the GCC Common Customs Law, the imposition of import VAT will also be suspended in the following cases:</p><ol><li>goods enter the UAE under temporary admission;</li><li>goods are placed in a customs warehouse;</li><li>goods are in transit; and</li><li>goods are intended to be re-exported by the same person who imported them.</li></ol><p>The FTA may require the importer to provide a financial guarantee or a cash deposit equal to the value of the VAT which would be due on import before allowing the goods not to be treated as imported in the UAE in respect of above categories.</p><p>In addition to the above, goods will not be treated as imported into the UAE if they are imported from outside the UAE to a UAE designated zone.</p><p>It should be noted that where any of above rules apply, the movement of goods into the UAE is not treated as an import, and therefore not subject to import VAT. If any conditions for the VAT suspension are subsequently broken, the goods may be treated as having been imported into the UAE and the VAT will become due on the import on the date the goods were originally imported.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection9.3.2><h3>VAT-free imports</h3><p>The second type of goods which are relieved from import VAT are goods which are exempt from customs duties in accordance with the GCC Common Customs Law. These are:</p><ol><li>goods imported by the military forces and internal security forces;</li><li>personal effects and gifts accompanied by travellers;</li><li>used personal effects and household items transported by UAE nationals living abroad on return or by expats moving to live in the UAE for the first time; and</li><li>returned goods.</li></ol><p>Goods falling under any of these categories are treated as having been imported into the UAE but are exempt from the imposition of VAT.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection9.4><h3>Designated zones</h3><p>Certain free zone areas in the UAE will be selected as 'designated zones'. Such areas are treated as outside the UAE for the purposes of supplies of certain goods.</p><p>In summary, the following rules apply to supplies related to designated zones.</p><table><tr><th>Type of supply</th><th>VAT treatment</th></tr><tr><td>A supply of goods within one designated zone.</td><td>The supply is treated as made outside the UAE, unless one of the exceptions in this table apply.</td></tr><tr><td>A supply of goods within a designated zone to be used by the recipient or by another third person, unless the goods are to be incorporated into, attached to or otherwise form part of or are used in the production or sale of another good located in the same designated zone which itself is not consumed.</td><td>The supply is treated as made in the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>A transfer of goods between two different designated zones.</td><td>Treated as a supply outside the UAE if all of the following conditions are met:<ul><li>the goods, or any part of the goods, are not released into free circulation during the transfer;</li><li>the goods, or any part of the goods, are not used or altered in any way during the transfer; and</li><li>the transfer is undertaken in accordance with the rules for customs suspension according to the GCC Common Customs Law.</li></ul>The FTA may request a financial guarantee in respect of any such movement of goods.</td></tr><tr><td>A supply of water or any form of energy in a designated zone.</td><td>The supply is treated as made in the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>A supply of any service in a designated zone.</td><td>The supply is treated as made in the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>Movement of goods from a designated zone to another part of the UAE which is not a designated zone.</td><td>The movement is treated as an import of goods into the UAE.</td></tr><tr><td>Movement or supply of goods from a part of the UAE which is not a designated zone into a designated zone.</td><td>The movement or supply is treated as a normal movement or supply within the UAE (not as an export).</td></tr></table><p>It should be noted that a company established within a designated zone is treated like any other company established in the UAE. Therefore, for example, a supply of services by a designated zone company to a company established in the UAE outside designated zones will be treated as a supply between two UAE companies. Similarly to any other UAE company, companies established in designated zones are required to register for VAT if the value of their taxable supplies exceeds the mandatory registration threshold of AED 375,000.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection10><h3>VAT recovery</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection10.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>In conducting their business activities, a taxable person will incur expenses which are subject to VAT. This VAT can be recovered by a taxable person, subject to certain conditions being met. This ensures that VAT will not normally be a cost to such a taxable person. Where the taxable person is not able to recover the VAT incurred in respect of goods or services, the person is, in effect, treated as the end-consumer for those goods or services.</p><p>The purpose of this chapter is to set out the circumstances in which taxable persons are entitled to recover input tax and the process they must follow to do so.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.2><h3>What is input tax?</h3><p>When a person purchases goods or services, the VAT incurred on the purchase or expense is called 'input tax'. In other words, VAT charged by the supplier is input tax of the recipient.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.3><h3>Entitlement to recover input tax</h3><p>If the purchaser is a taxable person and is registered for VAT then they may be able to recover the amount of VAT incurred. Purchasers who are not taxable persons are not, generally, entitled to recover any VAT on their purchases.</p><p>A taxable person is able to recover input tax incurred on the purchase of goods and services in the course of business, subject to certain conditions. The recovery of input tax will be permitted where acquired goods and services are used, or intended to be used, in making any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>taxable supplies;</p></li><li><p>supplies that are made outside the UAE which would have been considered taxable had they been made in the UAE; and</p></li><li><p>supplies of financial services which would have been treated as exempt if made in the UAE, but which are provided to a person who is outside the UAE and are treated as taking place outside the UAE.</p></li></ul><p>Where any acquisition by a taxable person relates solely to the supplies indicated above, the person will, in principle, be able to recover the input tax incurred in full. In contrast, where an acquisition is directly linked solely to non-business or exempt supplies made by the person, the person will not be able to recover any of the input tax incurred.</p><p>It is important to note that it is not necessary to link every purchase with the onward supply in the business' accounting system – particularly, as some purchases may be consumed by the business or used in the day-to-day running of the business, rather than being supplied on. Instead, the business must be able to identify expenses which are directly attributable to activities of the business that give rise to VAT recovery and expenses that are attributable to activities which do not allow for VAT recovery.</p><div class=example><h3>Example 12</h3><p>A law firm only provides services which are subject to VAT. The firm purchases new office desks for their employees.</p><p>Since the desks will be used by the law firm for the purpose of conducting their taxable activities, the law firm will be able to recover the VAT incurred on the purchase of the desks.</p></div><p>In certain circumstances, goods or services will be used partly in the course of making supplies that allow for the recovery of input tax and partly for making supplies for which VAT is not recoverable. Where an expense is used for making such mixed supplies, the taxable person must determine the portion of the input tax that can be recovered.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.4><h3>Input tax apportionment</h3><p>Input tax which is incurred in respect of goods or services which are used partly for making supplies that allow for VAT recovery and partly for making supplies for which VAT is not recoverable is known as 'residual' or 'overhead' input tax. This residual input tax must be apportioned between those activities. Recovery will be restricted to the proportion relating to supplies that allow for VAT recovery.</p><p>In order to determine the proportion of recoverable residual input tax, a calculation must be performed to determine the extent to which purchases are used to make recoverable supplies. The percentage resulting from the calculation is then applied to the residual input tax to determine the actual amount of the input tax that can be recovered.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection10.4.1><h3>Input tax apportionment calculation</h3><p>In order to determine the value of input tax which is recoverable by the business, the taxable person should use the following default calculation:</p><ol><li><p>Calculate the total value of input tax which is directly attributable only to supplies for which VAT may be recovered.</p></li><li><p>Calculate the total value of input tax which is directly attributable only to supplies for which VAT cannot be recovered.</p></li><li><p>Calculate the percentage to be applied to the residual input tax by dividing the total value of input tax identified under Step 1 by the sum of the input tax identified under Step 1 and Step 2. The percentage should be rounded to the nearest whole number.</p></li><li><p>Multiply the total value of residual input tax by the percentage calculated under Step 3. The resulting amount is the amount of residual input tax which can be recovered by the taxable person.</p></li><li><p>The total input tax that will be recoverable by the person for the period is the input tax calculated in Step 1 and Step 4.</p></li></ol><div class=example><h3>Example 13</h3><p>ABC LLC is a VAT registered business which makes taxable supplies and exempt supplies. ABC LLC must perform an input tax apportionment calculation to determine how much VAT is eligible for recovery for the period covering July – September. During the period ABC LLC has incurred a total of AED 300,000 of VAT.</p><ol><li><p>Total value of input tax directly attributable to taxable supplies: AED 75,000.</p></li><li><p>Total value of input tax directly attributable to exempt supplies: AED 50,000.</p></li><li><p>Total residual input tax: AED 175,000 (300,000 – 75,000 – 50,000).</p></li><li><p>Residual input tax recovery percentage: 60% (75,000 / (75,000+50,000).</p></li><li><p>Recoverable residual input tax: AED 105,000.</p></li><li><p>Total recoverable input tax: AED 180,000 (75,000 + 105,000).</p></li><li><p>Total irrecoverable input tax: AED 120,000 (50,000 + 70,000).</p></li></ol><p>AED 180,000 is the total input tax which may be recovered by ABC LLC for the tax period.</p></div><p>It should be noted that the FTA has discretion to allow taxable persons to use an alternative method of input tax apportionment from a list of methods it makes available, if the default method does not provide an outcome which is reflective of the actual use of the acquired goods or services. Such approval will be granted from the second year following the implementation of VAT in the UAE. Where the FTA has approved the use of an alternative method, the taxable person must continue using it for at least two years from the date of approval.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.4.2><h3>Annual wash-up calculation</h3><p>At the end of every 'tax year', a taxable person must perform a wash-up calculation to determine whether the overall recovery percentage calculated over the course of the year corresponds with the recovery percentages calculated for tax periods during that tax year.</p><p>The tax year of a taxable person is dependent on the person's tax periods. Specifically:</p><ol><li><p>For a taxable person registered for VAT on a quarterly tax period basis, the tax year is identified as follows:</p><ul><li><p>where the taxable person's tax period ends on 31 January and quarterly thereafter, the tax year ends on 31 January;</p></li><li><p>where the taxable person's tax period ends on last day of February and quarterly thereafter, the tax year ends on the last day of February; and</p></li><li><p>where the taxable person's tax period ends on 31 March and quarterly thereafter, the tax year ends on 31 March.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>For a taxable person registered for VAT on a monthly tax period basis, the tax year ends on the last day of the calendar year.</p></li></ol><p>The annual wash-up calculation requires the taxable person to:</p><ul><li><p>calculate the residual input tax which would have been recoverable if the residual input tax calculations were done for the whole tax year; and</p></li><li><p>compare the residual input tax calculated for the entire year with the residual input tax actually recovered in all the tax periods throughout the tax year.</p></li></ul><p>If the above comparison shows a difference, a corresponding adjustment must be made in the first tax period following the end of the relevant tax year. The adjustment will result in either additional recoverable input tax or a reduction in the input tax already recovered.</p><p>Furthermore, if there is a difference of more than AED 250,000 in any tax year between the recoverable input tax as calculated in accordance with the method described in this section and the input tax which would have been recoverable if the calculation was made on the basis of the actual use of the goods or services, then the taxable person should make an adjustment to the input tax in respect of the difference. The adjustment must be made in the first tax period following the end of the relevant tax year.</p><p>If the difference is less that AED 250,000, no adjustment is required to be made.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.5><h3>Conditions to be met to allow recovery of input tax</h3><p>A taxable person is able to recover input tax in the first tax period in which both of the following conditions are met:</p><ul><li><p>the taxable person has received and retained a tax invoice or other documentation evidencing the supply or import; and</p></li><li><p>the amount of VAT in question has been paid in whole or in part (in which case the amount of recoverable input tax shall be limited to the equivalent amount).</p></li></ul><p>If the taxable person has not recovered input tax in the tax period in which the conditions have been met, the person will be able to recover this input tax in the following tax period.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection10.5.1><h3>The recipient must hold the required evidence of their purchase</h3><p>Input tax can only be claimed by the recipient of goods or services if the recipient holds the required evidence in respect of the supply.</p><p>The required evidence takes several forms, the most common of which is a tax invoice. A tax invoice is a document which must satisfy certain conditions (see <a href=#bookmarkSection12 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 12</a> for further details regarding tax invoices).</p><p>In some situations, the recipient will not be able to obtain a valid tax invoice – for example, if the supply is made by a non-resident and was subject to the reverse charge in the UAE. In these circumstances, the recipient is able to evidence the supply by obtaining and retaining the following documents:</p><ul><li><p>the supplier's invoice showing details of the goods and services;</p></li><li><p>in the case of imported goods, a statement from the relevant Customs authority showing details of the imported goods.</p></li></ul><p>If the taxable person has not received the tax invoice or other acceptable documentation in the tax period when the supply was made, they may deduct the input tax in the tax period in which the tax invoice or the alternative documents are received.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.5.2><h3>The person must have paid or intend to pay for the supply</h3><p>The amount of input tax that can be reclaimed by a taxable person is the amount of input tax that relates to the portion of consideration for the supply that has already been paid. However, the condition will also be met if the person intends to make the payment within six months of the due date of payment.</p><p>For example, if the supplier has only issued a partial invoice for the supply and the recipient made the payment, the recipient can only recover VAT for the payment made. The recipient cannot recover VAT in respect of the portion of consideration which has not yet been invoiced or paid.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.6><h3>Blocked input tax</h3><p>Input tax on certain expenses incurred by a person is specifically blocked from being recoverable.

However, where the motor vehicle is available for the personal use of any person, the taxable person will lose the right to recover the VAT incurred.</p><p>For the purpose of this rule, the 'motor vehicle' is any road vehicle which is designed or adapted for the conveyance of no more than 10 people, including the driver. 'Motor vehicle' does not include a truck, forklift, hoist or other similar vehicles. This ensures that VAT on essentially commercial vehicles is not blocked due to incidental private use.</p><p>A motor vehicle will not be treated as being available for private use if it is within any of the following categories:</p><ul><li><p>a taxi licensed by a competent authority;</p></li><li><p>a motor vehicle registered as, and used as an emergency vehicle, including by the police, fire brigade, paramedics, or similar emergency services; and</p></li><li><p>a vehicle which is used in a vehicle rental business where it is rented to a customer.</p></li></ul></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.6.3><h3>Employee-related expenses</h3><p>The third category of expenses which do not give rise to VAT recovery are certain expenses incurred by a business for the purposes of their employees.</p><p>VAT on employee-related expenses will not be recoverable by the business where goods or services are purchased to be used by employees for no charge to them and for their personal benefit.</p><p>There are, however, certain exceptions from the above rule. Thus, the rule will not apply in the following situations:</p><ol><li><p>Where the employer has a legal obligation to provide those goods or services to the employees under any applicable UAE labour law.</p></li><li><p>Where it is a contractual obligation or documented policy of the employer to provide those goods or services to employees to enable them to perform their role and where it can be proven to be normal business practice to do so in the course of employment.</p></li><li><p>Where the provision of goods or services is a deemed supply.</p></li></ol><p>As a consequence, determination regarding whether input tax can be recovered in respect of an employee-related expense has to be made on a case by case basis. For example, where a business incurs compulsory medical insurance or visa costs to enable their employees to perform their duties, such costs will not be blocked under the rule. In contrast, where an employer buys a gift for the employee in appreciation for their good service, the employer would be prevented from recovering VAT on the purchase of the gift, unless it is also treated as a deemed supply.</p><p>It should be noted that even if input tax on the employee-related expense is not blocked under the rule described in this section, it does not follow that the business can definitely recover the VAT incurred. Input tax recovery can only be made if the normal conditions for input tax recovery are met – for example, the expense must be related to business activities that allow for the recovery of VAT.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection10.7><h3>Special refund schemes</h3><p>In keeping with other global VAT regimes, the UAE will allow certain parties who have incurred VAT in the UAE to recover this VAT, even if they are not taxable persons in the UAE.</p><p>Special refunds will be available to the following categories of persons:</p><ul><li><p>UAE citizens in respect of the construction of residences;</p></li><li><p>business visitors;</p></li><li><p>tourist visitors;</p></li><li><p>foreign governments, diplomatic bodies and missions, and some other international organizations; and</p></li><li><p>any other persons or classes of persons listed in a Cabinet Decision issued at the suggestion of the Minister.</p></li></ul><p>Since this guide concerns taxable persons, it does not cover these special refund schemes in detail.

This Law addresses more generic tax compliance issues, and amongst other things, details other penalties and administrative surcharges which can be applied for VAT compliance failures, and which are also relevant to other taxes.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection11.2><h3>Understanding tax liability</h3><p>The below summarises the key terms explained in earlier chapters with respect to the operation of VAT, and how these impact a taxable person's tax liability.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection11.2.1><h3>Output tax</h3><p>'Output tax' is the VAT a taxable person calculates and charges on their own supplies of goods and services once they are registered for VAT. Output tax must generally be calculated on supplies to other persons; however, in certain situations VAT might be required to be charged on supplies which were deemed to occur for VAT purposes or on expenses which are subject to a reverse charge.</p><p>The obligation to account for output tax arises at the tax point for the supply, i.e. at the date of supply. Once the date of supply has taken place, the taxable person must account for the output tax in the tax return covering that tax period.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection11.2.2><h3>Input tax</h3><p>From the recipient's point of view, 'input tax' is the VAT added to the price by the supplier when the recipient purchases goods or services which are subject to VAT. If the recipient is registered for VAT then they may be able to recover this input tax from the FTA, subject to the conditions set out in<a href=#bookmarkSection10 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 10</a> above.</p><p>In general, a taxable person is able to recover input tax in the first tax period in which both of the following conditions are met:</p><ul><li><p>the taxable person has received and retained a tax invoice or other documentation evidencing the amount of VAT on the supply or import; and</p></li><li><p>the amount of VAT has been paid, or is intended to be paid, in whole or in part (in which case the amount of input tax recoverable shall be limited to the equivalent amount).</p></li></ul><p>Once the ability to recover input tax has been confirmed, the person is able to include the amount in the relevant tax return as an input tax deduction.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection11.2.3><h3>Calculating tax liability</h3><p>A registered person's tax liability is simply the difference between the output tax payable for a given tax period and the input tax which is recoverable for the same tax period.</p><p>Where the output tax exceeds the input tax amount, a payment of the difference must be made to the FTA.</p><p>Where the amount of input tax exceeds the amount of output tax, a taxable person is entitled to a refund of VAT from the FTA.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection11.3><h3>Filing tax returns</h3><p>For each tax period, a taxable person will be required to submit a tax return which contains details regarding the supplies made or received by the taxable person.</p><p>With respect to sales and other outputs, the taxable person will need to report:</p><ol><li><p>supplies of goods and services made which are subject to the standard rate of VAT;</p></li><li><p>supplies of goods and services made which are subject to the zero rate of VAT;</p></li><li><p>supplies of goods and services made to the taxable person which are subject to the reverse charge provisions.</p></li><li><p>tax refunds provided to tourists under the Tax Refunds for Tourists Scheme, in case the taxable person is a retailer and provides tax refunds to tourists in the UAE under the official tourists refund scheme;</p></li><li><p>supplies made which are exempt from VAT; and</p></li><li><p>where applicable, amendments or corrections required from previous periods to output VAT amounts.</p></li></ol><p>With respect to purchases and other inputs, the taxable person should report:</p><ol><li><p>purchases and expenses for which the taxable person would like to recover VAT; and</p></li><li><p>where applicable, amendments or corrections required from previous periods to input VAT amounts.</p></li></ol><p>The amounts of VAT charged by the taxable person and input tax recoverable by the person would then need to be netted off in the tax return. The resulting amount is the net VAT payable to, or to be refunded by, the FTA.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection11.3.1><h3>Due date for submitting tax returns</h3><p>The due date for submitting tax returns and making a payment of payable tax to the FTA is the 28th day following the end of the tax period to which the tax return relates. It should be noted that where a payment is due to the FTA, it must be received by the FTA by the deadline.</p><p>Where the due date for the submission of the tax return and the corresponding payment falls on a weekend or a national holiday, the deadline for filing the tax return or making a payment is extended to the first working day following this.</p><p>Submitting a tax return or making a payment of tax late will result in a penalty levied by the FTA.</p><p>All tax returns should be submitted online using the FTA portal. The return can be submitted by the taxable person, or another person who has the right to do so on the taxable person's behalf (for example, a tax agent or a legal representative).</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection11.3.2><h3>Correcting errors</h3><p>Where a taxable person has made an error (for example, calculated output tax incorrectly or recovered the incorrect amount of input tax), then the person is required to correct this error.</p><p>Where the correction is required in respect of a tax return or a tax assessment, and the total value of the error is less than AED 10,000, the taxable person may correct the error on the tax return for the tax period in which the error was discovered. In all other cases, the taxable person must disclose the error to the FTA within 20 business days of becoming aware of the error, and request the FTA to correct the error.</p><p>By making a voluntary disclosure the taxable person may be eligible for a reduction in any applicable penalty. However, where a voluntary disclosure is submitted to the FTA after the taxable person has received notice of a tax audit or while a tax audit in in progress, the voluntary disclosure will either reduce penalties to some extent or not at all.</p></article></section></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection12><h3>Tax invoices</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection12.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>The purpose of this chapter is to outline the guidance surrounding the requirement to issue a tax invoice.</p><p>A tax invoice is a written paper or electronic document which records the details of a taxable supply which has been made.</p><p>The issue of a valid tax invoice is important for suppliers as it may be used to dictate the date of supply, and therefore determines the tax period in which the output tax should be accounted for.

A person making a supply to another GCC Implementing State where the place of supply is in that state must, however, issue a document which contains most requirements of the tax invoice (please refer to <a href=#bookmarkSection12.3 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>section 12.3 of this Chapter</a>).</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.2.2><h3>Who must issue a tax invoice?</h3><p>A tax invoice must normally be issued, or arranged to be issued, by a supplier of goods or services. However, in certain situations a tax invoice may either not be required or may be issued by another person.</p><p><em> Buyer-created tax invoices</em></p><p>In certain commercial situations, it may be easier for a recipient of goods or services to identify the particulars of what has been supplied, and therefore to issue a tax invoice. For example, where scrap metal is sold to a scrapyard, the details of the supply (e.g. the quality and value of scrap metal) might not be known until the scrap is received and valued at the scrapyard. In these situations, the supplier and the recipient may agree that the recipient will issue the tax invoice instead of the supplier. Such a tax invoice would then be treated as if it had been issued by the supplier and therefore conditions for issuing a tax invoice have been met.</p><p>A buyer-created tax invoice may be issued where:</p><ul><li><p>the recipient is registered for VAT; and</p></li><li><p>the supplier and the recipient agree in writing that the supplier will not issue a tax invoice in respect of any supply to the recipient.</p></li></ul><p>Where the conditions above are met, the recipient will be able to issue a tax invoice for a purchase. Such a tax invoice must contain all the particulars normally required in a tax invoice and must be identified by the words 'buyer-created tax invoice'.</p><p>Where a buyer-created tax invoice is issued, the supplier should not issue a separate tax invoice. In such cases, any document issued by the supplier purporting to be a tax invoice will not be a valid tax invoice.</p><p><em>Invoices issued by agents</em></p><p>Where a VAT-registered agent makes a supply of goods or services on behalf of the principal supplier of those goods or services, the agent may issue a tax invoice in relation to that supply with the particulars of the agent (such as name, address and TRN) – as if that agent had made the supply of goods or services itself. The invoice should, however, contain a reference to the principal supplier (including the supplier's name and TRN) somewhere on the invoice.</p><p>If the agent issues an invoice on behalf of the principal supplier, the principal supplier should not issue their own tax invoice.</p><p>Where the invoice is issued by the agent, the supply is still treated as being made by the principal supplier to the recipient of the supply. As a consequence, the supplier has to account for the relevant VAT and must comply with all the record-keeping requirements in respect of the supply.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.2.3><h3>Timing for issuing tax invoices</h3><p>A tax invoice must be issued within 14 calendar days of the date of supply. For further information on the date of supply please refer to <a href=#bookmarkSection8 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Chapter 8</a>.</p><p>The only exception to this rule is a summary tax invoice that may be issued by a taxable person. Where a taxable person makes more than one supply of goods or services to the same recipient during a month, the taxable person may issue a single tax invoice for these supplies in the same calendar month as the supplies took place. In these circumstances, the summary tax invoice will be treated as issued on time, even if it is issued more than 14 day from the date of supply of any supply covered by the tax invoice.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.3><h3>Key information on a tax invoice</h3><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection12.3.1><h3>Full and simplified tax invoices</h3><p>In order for a tax invoice to be valid it must contain the following particulars:</p><ul><li><p>the words 'Tax Invoice' clearly displayed on the invoice;</p></li><li><p>the name, address, and TRN of the supplier;</p></li><li><p>where the recipient of the supply is registered for VAT, the name, address, and TRN of the recipient;</p></li><li><p>a sequential tax invoice number or a unique invoice number;</p></li><li><p>the date of issuing the tax invoice;</p></li><li><p>the date of supply (where different from date of issue of the tax invoice);</p></li><li><p>a description of the goods or services supplied;</p></li><li><p>for each good or service, the unit price, the quantity or volume supplied, the rate of VAT and the amount payable expressed in AED;</p></li><li><p>the amount of any discount offered;</p></li><li><p>the gross amount payable expressed in AED;</p></li><li><p>the tax amount payable expressed in AED together with the rate of exchange applied; and</p></li><li><p>where the invoice relates to a supply under which the recipient is required to account for VAT, a statement that the recipient is required to account for VAT, and a reference to the relevant provision of the Law.</p></li></ul><p>In addition to a 'full' tax invoice, in certain situations a person may issue a 'simplified tax invoice'.

The invoice may still contain information regarding prices in the original currency.</p><p>When converting the foreign currency into the UAE Dirham, the exchange rate used must be a rate approved by the UAE Central Bank.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.3.4><h3>Rounding rules</h3><p>Where the invoice amount is a fraction of a fils, the amount should be rounded to the nearest fils (that is, to two decimal places) on a mathematical basis, being:</p><ul><li><p>rounded up if the fraction is a half or more; and</p></li><li><p>rounded down if the fraction is less than a half.</p></li></ul></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.3.5><h3>Invoices within a tax group</h3><p>A tax group is a single entity for VAT purposes meaning supplies between members of the same tax group are disregarded for VAT purposes. As such, there is no need to account for VAT or issue tax invoices in respect of intra-group supplies.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection12.4><h3>Adjusting output tax on tax invoices</h3><p>There may be instances where output tax originally charged on a supply has to be adjusted – for example, due to an adjustment of the price or due to a mistake.</p><p>In such instances, the supplier must account for the correct amount of VAT, and must issue a document recording the correction.</p><p>Thus, where the output tax charged is less than the output tax that should have been charged following the adjustment (i.e. there has been a price increase), the supplier must issue a tax invoice for the difference and provide it to the recipient, with the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>the supplier has to account for the additional output tax to the FTA on the tax return that relates to the tax period in which the adjustment is made; and</p></li><li><p>the recipient can treat the additional VAT incurred as input tax subject to the normal input tax recovery rules in the tax return for the tax period in which the tax invoice is received.</p></li></ul><p>In contrast, where the output tax charged is more than the output tax that should have been charged following the adjustment (i.e. there has been a price decrease), the supplier must issue, and provide to the recipient, a tax credit note, with the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>the supplier can recover from the FTA the output tax which was previously accounted for in respect of the amount of reduction, by reducing the output tax in the tax return for the tax period in which the adjustment is made; and</p></li><li><p>the recipient must reduce their input tax by the amount of VAT related to the reduced amount in the tax return for the tax period in which the tax credit note is received.</p></li></ul><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection12.4.1><h3>Key requirements of a tax credit note</h3><p>In order for a tax credit note to be valid, it must reflect the error in the original tax invoice. Therefore, a credit note should contain the following:</p><ul><li><p>the words 'Tax Credit Note';</p></li><li><p>the name, address, and TRN of the supplier;</p></li><li><p>where the recipient is registered for VAT, their name, address, and TRN;</p></li><li><p>the date of issuing the tax credit note;</p></li><li><p>the value of the supply shown on the tax invoice, the correct amount of the value of the supply, the difference between those two amounts, and the VAT charged that relates to that difference in AED;</p></li><li><p>a brief explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the adjustment; and</p></li><li><p>information sufficient to identify the supply to which the adjustment relates.</p></li></ul><p>Similar to tax invoices, the FTA has the ability to determine situations when tax credit notes are unnecessary or can contain different particulars. Similarly, a tax credit note may be issued by a VAT registered agent of the taxable person making a supply or by the recipient of the supply with the agreement of the supplier (with words 'buyer-created tax credit note' clearly displayed on the credit note).</p></article></section></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection13><h3>Record keeping</h3><section class=level-2><article id=bookmarkSection13.1><h3>Chapter summary</h3><p>In order to properly facilitate the administration of VAT, all taxable persons are required to maintain certain business records for a specified period of time. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize which records must be maintained and the time periods for which they must be retained.</p><p>The retention of records is essential and enables businesses to pay the correct amount of tax.

Before the expiration of the 5-year term, the FTA may, however, require the person to retain the records for a further period not exceeding 4 years, in the following cases:</p><ul><li><p>if the taxable person's tax obligations are subject to a dispute with the FTA;</p></li><li><p>if the person is subject to an ongoing tax audit; or</p></li><li><p>if the FTA has given a notice to the person that it intends to conduct a tax audit before the expiry of the 5-year record retention period.</p></li></ul><p>Where the taxable person owns real estate, the taxable person should retain the required records relating to the real estate for a period of 15 years after the end of the tax period to which they relate.</p></article></section></article><article id=bookmarkSection13.3><h3>Archiving and retrieval requirements</h3><p>Businesses do not have to keep their records in any specific way or format. However, they must be kept in a way which will allow the FTA to easily check the information which has been used to complete the tax return. Furthermore, regardless of whichever way a taxable person chooses to store their archived records, they need to be made readily available in a legible format on request by the FTA.</p><p>Examples of the manner in which records can be archived include:</p><ul><li><p>Retention of the original documents (e.g. in paper or electronic form);</p></li><li><p>Creating photocopies of the original documents; and</p></li><li><p>Other ways of recording and preserving the information or data contained in the original document.</p></li></ul><p>A taxable person is not required to keep records on their premises.

Under the tax audit process, the FTA is entitled to examine the records required to be preserved by a taxable person under the law and to generally inspect the circumstances of their business. A tax audit may be carried out at the taxable person's business premises (i.e. a 'field tax audit') or in the offices of the FTA. Generally, prior notification of a tax audit will be given.</p><p>In the process of carrying out a tax audit, the FTA may make copies of, take extracts from, or samples of any information or goods as it may deem necessary.</p></article><article id=bookmarkSection15.2><h3>Why is a tax audit necessary?</h3><p>VAT is a self-assessment tax, meaning that taxable persons themselves declare the amount of tax payable to or recoverable from the FTA on their tax returns. The tax audit provides the FTA with a mechanism for checking whether such a declaration is correct.</p><p>If as a result of the audit an underpayment of VAT is discovered, the FTA can issue an assessment to require payment of the relevant VAT, together with issuing penalties.</p><section class=level-3><article id=bookmarkSection15.2.1><h3>How often will a business be audited?</h3><p>Not all taxable persons will be audited with the same frequency. The FTA will determine which persons should be audited and with what regularity – based on the risk to the public revenue.
