href='/articles/uae-cit-article-27' target='_blank' rel='noopenernoreferrer'>27</a> of this Decree-Law.</p></li><li><p>Where a Taxable Person fails to hold a 5% (five percent) or greater ownership interest in the Participation for an uninterrupted period of at least (12) twelve months, any income previously not taken into account under this Article shall be included in the calculation of the Taxable Income in the Tax Period in which the ownership interest in the Participation falls below 5% (five percent).</p></li><li><p>The Minister may prescribe that an ownership interest in the shares
