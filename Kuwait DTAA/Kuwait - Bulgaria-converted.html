                <p>Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.</p>

            <li>
                <p>The term "royalties" as used in this article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films and films or tapes and other means of image or sound reproduction for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for transmission by satellite, cable, fibre optic or similar technology, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.</p>

In such case the provisions of <a href="#article7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art. 7</a> or <a href="#article14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art. 14</a>, as the case may be, shall apply.</p>

                <p>Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment, or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.</p>
            </li>
