> Create a valid HTML5 document that replicates the following structure with multiple `<article>` sections. Each section should have a unique `id` and include headings, paragraphs, ordered lists (with potential nested lists), strong text, and hyperlinks with Target=_blank rel= noopenner noreferrer as appropriate. Modify the content in each section to reflect new definitions, explanations, and examples while keeping the structure and semantics consistent with the reference.
> 
> **Requirements:**
> 
> 1. **General Structure:**
>    - The document must include several `<article>` elements with unique `id` attributes (e.g., `bookmarkSection1` through `bookmarkSection9`).
>    - Each `<article>` should contain a `<h3>` heading indicating the section title.
> 
> 2. **Content Specifications:**
>    - **Section 1 (Definitions):**  
>      - Include a brief introduction paragraph.
>      - List several definitions using paragraphs with `<strong>` to highlight key terms.  
>    - **Section 2 (Scope of Application):**  
>      - Provide a clear statement of the scope in one or more paragraphs.
>    - **Section 3 (Qualifying Income):**  
>      - Use an ordered list to itemize different income categories.
>      - Include nested ordered lists where needed.
>      - Use `<a>` tags for any references to external articles or sections.
>    - **Section 4 (De minimis Requirements):**  
>      - Describe de minimis thresholds with an ordered list.
>      - Include nested lists for detailed items.
>    - **Section 5 (Income Attributable to a Domestic or Foreign Permanent Establishment):**  
>      - List points that describe taxable income attribution.
>    - **Section 6 (Income Attributable to Immovable Property Located in a Free Zone):**  
>      - Create an ordered list describing the income attribution rules.
>    - **Section 7 (Maintaining Adequate Substance and Outsourcing):**  
>      - Explain the substance requirements and conditions for outsourcing in an ordered list.
>    - **Section 8 (Implementing Decisions):**  
>      - Provide a simple paragraph about how implementing decisions are issued.
>    - **Section 9 (Publication and Application):**  
>      - Include a paragraph stating publication details and effective dates.
> 
> 3. **Additional Instructions:**
>    - Replace the example content with new text while maintaining clarity and a similar informational tone.
>    - Ensure all nested lists are properly indented and follow valid HTML syntax.
>    - The final output should be a standalone snippet that could be inserted into a larger HTML page.
> 
> **Example Reference Structure:**
> ```html
> <article id="bookmarkSection1">
