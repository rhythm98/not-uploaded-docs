    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>With reference to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/DTAA/andorra%20copy.html#l9">paragraph 1 of Article 5 (Residence)</a>:</p>
            <ol class="roman">
                
                <li>
                    <p>It is understood that an investment fund and a pension fund or scheme of a Contracting State are considered to be residents of that State.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The term “investment fund” means an investment fund, arrangement or entity of a Contracting State which the competent authority of the Contracting State agrees to regard as a collective investment vehicle for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The term “pension fund or scheme” means any plan, scheme, fund, trust, or other arrangement which, is generally exempt from tax and operated principally either to administer or provide pension or retirement benefit or to earn income for the benefit of one or more such arrangements.</p>
                    <p>In particular:</p>
                    <ol class="alpha">
                        <li>
                            <p>in the case of the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi Retirement Pensions and Benefits Fund and the General Pension and Social Security Authority;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>in the case of Andorra, a pension fund or scheme within the meaning of the Law Regulating the activity of Insurance companies of 11 May 1989 and any other law or regulation that may develop or modify this law in the future;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>any other pension fund or scheme of a Contracting State which the competent authority of the Contracting State agrees to regard as a pension fund or scheme for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

            <p>With reference to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/DTAA/andorra%20copy.html#l41">Article 26 (Exchange of Information)</a>:</p>
            <ol class="roman">
                <li>
                    <p>Requests for information made under the Convention shall be processed as provided in the Convention, in accordance with the guidelines contained in the following provisions:</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>It is understood that the standard of "foreseeable relevance" is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in "fishing expeditions" or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer.</p>
                            <p>Requests for information should be as detailed as possible, including the following information:</p>
                            
                            <ol class="numeric">

                                    <p>the reasons why the information requested is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of the Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the tax laws of the requesting State in regard to the person identified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph;</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>grounds for believing that the information requested is held in the requested State or is in the possession or control of a person within the jurisdiction of the requested State or can be obtained by such person;</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>a statement that the request is in conformity with the laws and administrative practices of the requesting State, and that the requesting State is authorised to obtain the information under the laws of the requesting State or in the normal course of administrative practice in similar circumstances, in response to a valid request of a Contracting State under the Convention;</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>a statement that the requesting State has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information, except those that would give rise to disproportionate difficulties.</p>

                            </ol>
                            <p>The above requirements contain procedural requirements that must be interpreted with a view not to frustrate effective exchange of information.</p>
