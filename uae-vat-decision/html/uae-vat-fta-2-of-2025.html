                                If the Authority has issued a clarification for the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall
                                have the right
                                to rely on this clarification to ascertain his tax obligation or penalty, and the
                                Authority
                                shall be administratively bound to implement the clarification. However, it should
                                be noted
                                that:</p>
                            <ul>

                                        The clarification is limited only to the concerned taxpayer or taxpayers who
                                        have
                                        requested for the clarification to be issued. If the clarification relates
                                        to a tax
                                        group, the clarification shall be limited only to the concerned group
                                        members. This
                                        means that the clarification issued by the Authority shall not be applicable
                                        to third
                                        parties. However, an exception is made for specific cases in which the
                                        Authority may
                                        issue a clarification for a specific category of taxpayers based on the same
                                        facts
                                        provided all the members of the category are parties to the same
                                        transaction.</p>

                                        where such clarification is relied upon and where the factual circumstances
                                        are the same
                                        as contained in the clarification form provided in the clarification
                                        Request.</p>

                                        The Authority may determine a period so that the clarification expires after

                                        of that specified period. In any event, a clarification shall cease to have
                                        effect if
                                        the relevant legislation on which it is based is amended.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In all cases, the Authority shall be able to withdraw the clarification if
                                        it is
                                        considered incorrect, and in that case the person may act as indicated in
                                        the
                                        clarification until the date of being notified of the withdrawal by the

                                        If the Authority issues a subsequent clarification to the taxpayer on the
                                        subject issued
                                        earlier, the subsequent decision shall supersede the previous decision. The

                        <p>This section
                            deals with the mechanism for issuing directives through administrative exception decisions,
                            input tax
                            apportionment decisions, and advance pricing agreements, as follows:</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol>

                        <p><strong>Administrative exceptions: </strong></p>
                    </li>
                    <p>In
                        light of the tax legislation, the Authority may grant administrative exceptions in certain
                        situations
                        whenever the conditions and controls stipulated in the tax legislation are met. The nature
                        of these
                        exceptions varies and falls under both the value added tax and the excise tax. Those related
                        to the
                        value added tax are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>tax invoices,

                            <p>tax credit
                                notes,</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>evidence proving
                                the export of goods, and</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>the period
                                required to the export goods.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As for excise
                        tax, an administrative exception is granted in relation to the evidence proving the
                        export of
                        goods.</p>

                        issued to

                        contained in

                        <li>
                            <p>

                                exception decision must be issued, from the date of receipt of the

                                into account the nature of each category of administrative exceptions. Thus,

                                exception decisions according to the category. If further information is
                                needed to
                                respond to the administrative exception request, the Authority shall

                                the applicant to request such information to be provided in accordance with

                                administrative exception decision is likely to take more than the period
                                determined by
                                the Authority, the Authority shall inform the applicant of the potential

                        purposes that do not allow input tax recovery.</p>
                    <p>
                        Article 55 of the VAT Executive Regulation provides a Standard mechanism for input tax
                        apportionment,
                        but in some cases the Standard mechanism is not appropriate in accordance with the controls
                        stipulated
                        in tax legislation. According to Clauses 13 and 14 of the same Article, the Authority allows
                        the use of
                        alternative mechanisms depending on the case. These mechanisms are determined according to a
                        specific
                        list (in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation).</p>
                    <p>
                        According to Clause 16 of the same Article, the Authority may permit the taxable person to
                        apply to the
                        Authority for approval of the use of a specified recovery percentage to calculate the
                        recoverable input
                        tax in any tax period based on the recovery percentage of the preceding tax year.</p>
                    <p>
                        Accordingly, where the taxable person falls within the business sectors specified in FTA
                        Decision No. 8,
                        the recovery percentage of the preceding year shall be the percentage calculated at the end
                        of the
                        previous year based on the mechanism allocated to their business sector according to FTA
                        Decision No. 8,
                        whether such taxable person is using an alternative mechanism that was approved by the
                        Authority or not.
                        Where the taxable person does not fall within the business sectors specified in FTA Decision
                        No. 8 and
                        uses the Standard mechanism for input tax recovery, the recovery percentage of the preceding
                        year shall
                        be considered the actual recovery percentage of the preceding Tax year that is calculated
                        according to
                        Clauses 9, 10 and 11 of the same Article.</p>

                    <p>- <u>Framework for Implementing Input Tax Apportionment Decisions:</u></p>
                    <p>
                        The Authority is committed to applying the input tax apportionment decision issued
                        to the
                        applicant in instances where the facts and information provided match those
                        contained in the
                        request, according to the following controls:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The decision to approve requests shall be effective from the first tax
                                period beginning
                                after the issuance of the decision, taking into account applying such
                                decision for the
                                period specified in Federal Tax Authority Decision No. 8.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                If approval to use an alternative mechanism is granted, the registrant must
                                use the
                                alternative mechanism that was approved for a period of two or four years,
                                depending on
                                the approved method.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Such alternative mechanism represents the taxable person&#39;s actual use,
                        which does
                        not change for a number of years unless the taxable person&#39;s business
                        changes.
                        Accordingly, the Authority must direct the taxable person to recalculate the
                        adjustments
                        related to the actual use for a number of previous years.</p>
                    <p>
                        Since the VAT Law and the VAT Executive Regulation do not specify a period
                        for the
                        recalculation whereas Article 55(18) of the VAT Executive Regulation states
                        that the
                        Authority shall set out the conditions for using the alternative method, the
                        period
                        shall be specified at only three tax years as it will be administratively
                        difficult for
                        the taxable person to make recalculations for a period exceeding three tax
                        years. As for
                        the tax years preceding those three tax years, the method used by the
                        taxable person is
                        acceptable provided that it is fair and reasonable.</p>

                                The Authority shall specify the allowed timeline within which the input tax
                                apportionment
                                decision or the further information request must be issued from the date of receipt
                                of the input
                                tax apportionment request or after receiving all the relevant information from the
                                applicant,
                                taking into account the nature of each category of input tax apportionment. Thus,
                                the Authority
                                has the right to specify different time periods for issuing the input tax
                                apportionment decision
                                according to the category. If more information is needed to respond to the input tax
                                apportionment request, the Authority shall communicate with the applicant to request
                                further
                                information in accordance with the procedures established by the Authority within a
                                specified
                                period, and a new timeline shall begin from the date of receipt of the required
                                information. If
                                the issuance of the input tax apportionment decision is likely to take more than the
                                period
                                determined by the Authority, the Authority must inform the applicant of the

                                during which the input tax apportionment decision or the further information request
