            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>Taxable persons are required to impose VAT on every taxable supply and deemed supply made by that person
                in the UAE. VAT is also imposed on the importation of concerned goods. <sup><a href="#footnote1"
                        id="footnoteback1">[1]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The supply of goods within a designated zone is generally regarded as being outside the scope of UAE VAT,
                unless the goods are supplied to be consumed. For the purposes of this Public Clarification, a
                designated zone is not considered to be within the UAE unless stated otherwise.</p>

            <p>In instances where goods are supplied within a designated zone for consumption (within or outside the
                designated zone) the place of supply of these goods shall generally be in the UAE, unless a specific
                exclusion applies. In lieu of such an exclusion, such supplies may potentially be subject to double
                taxation, i.e. on the transfer of ownership of the goods as well as on importation thereof. <sup><a
                        href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The place of supply of services is generally regarded as being inside the UAE if supplied in the
                designated zone. <sup><a href="#footnote3" id="footnoteback3">[3]</a></sup> In lieu of a special
                exclusion, the place of supply of shipping or
                delivery services in respect of goods moved from a designated zone is in the UAE and may require
                non-resident suppliers of these services to register for VAT in the UAE. <sup><a href="#footnote4"
                        id="footnoteback4">[4]</a></sup></p>

            <p>In order to avoid double taxation on goods supplied from a designated zone, and to provide registration
                relief to non-resident suppliers who also ship or deliver these goods, Article 51 of Cabinet Decision
                No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax,
                was amended by Cabinet Decision No. 88 of 2021 ("Executive Regulation"), with effect from 30 October
                2021.</p>

            <p>This Public Clarification provides guidance on the application of Article 51(5) and (7) of the Executive
                Regulation.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Article 51(5) of the Executive Regulation<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup> was
                amended to treat the supply of goods in the
                designated zone as outside the scope of UAE VAT if the goods are consumed outside the designated zone,
                provided evidence is obtained and retained that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>the goods were delivered to a place outside the UAE; or</p></li>
                <li><p>VAT was paid on the importation of those goods into the UAE.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>For purposes of this Public Clarification, the goods mentioned in the previous paragraph are collectively
                referred to as "Qualifying Goods" where all the requirements of Article 51(5)(b) or (c) of the Executive
                Regulation are met. <sup><a href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <p>The service of shipping / delivery of Qualifying Goods is also outside the scope of UAE VAT if supplied
                by the same supplier of the goods, provided the supplier is a non-resident who is not registered for VAT
                in the UAE. <sup><a href="#footnote5" id="footnoteback5">[5]</a></sup></p>

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p><i>General</i></p>
            <p>Taxable persons are required to impose VAT on all taxable supplies made in the UAE. <sup><a
                        href="#footnote6" id="footnoteback6">[6]</a></sup>
                Designated zones specified by a Cabinet Decision are generally treated as being outside the UAE if they
                meet the requirements listed in Article 51(1) of the Executive Regulation, which include that the area
                is fenced and has security measures and Customs controls in place to monitor entry and exit of
                individuals and movement of goods. <sup><a href="#footnote7" id="footnoteback7">[7]</a></sup></p>

            <p>As an exception to the above, where goods are supplied within a designated zone, and the goods are
                intended to be consumed in or outside the UAE, such goods shall generally be regarded as being supplied
                in the UAE.</p>

            <p>The term "consumed" is interpreted broadly as including any utilisation, application, employment,
                deployment or exploitation of the goods. The resale of purchased goods is not treated as consumption of
                the goods. Therefore, a supply of goods would be outside the scope of UAE VAT if the purchaser intends
                to sell them.</p>

            <p>However, the place of supply of goods will be regarded as being outside the UAE, if one of the following
                exclusions applies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>
                    <p>The goods are:</p>
                    <ul class="dashed">
                        <li><p>incorporated into,</p></li>
                        <li><p>attached to,</p></li>
                        <li><p>become part of, or</p></li>
                        <li><p>used in the production of,</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>another good in the same designated zone, and that such other good is not consumed.</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this Public Clarification, the above terms are collectively referred to as
                        "production" of another good.</p>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <p>The goods were delivered to a place outside the UAE, and the supplier retains:</p>
                    <ul class="dashed">
                        <li><p>Customs evidence proving that the goods were moved from the designated zone; and</p></li>
                        <li><p>Supporting commercial or official evidence proving the delivery of the goods to a place
                            outside the UAE.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    <p>The goods were moved from the designated zone to a place within the UAE, and the supplier retains
                        a document issued by the relevant Customs Department, proving that the goods have been imported
                        as well as proof that VAT was settled on the same.
                </p></li>
                </p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>The onus is on the supplier to ensure that it treats a supply correctly for VAT purposes. Therefore, as a
                general rule, suppliers should not treat supplies of goods as being outside the scope of UAE VAT, unless
                they are satisfied that one of the above exclusions applies.</p>

            <p><i>1. Goods incorporated/attached to/become part of/ are used in production of other goods</i></p>
            <p>For this exclusion to apply:</p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><p>there has to be a direct connection between the purchased goods and the resulting goods after
                    production, and</p></li>
                <li><p>the resulting goods should not be supplied to be consumed.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the above two conditions are met, the place of supply of the goods will be outside the UAE and,
                therefore, outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p>

            <p><i>2. Goods delivered outside the UAE</i></p>
            <p>For this exclusion to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><p>the goods are moved from the designated zone to be delivered outside the UAE;</p></li>
                <li><p>the supplier obtains and retains the relevant Customs documents proving the movement of the goods
                    from the designated zone; and</p></li>
                <li><p>the supplier retains commercial or official evidence that the goods were delivered to a place
                    outside the UAE.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>In instances where the goods will be moved from the designated zone to be delivered outside the UAE,
                consumption would generally be regarded as taking place outside the UAE. Hence such instances shall be
                regarded as having a place of supply outside the UAE.</p>

            <p>However, in order to prove that the goods were moved from the designated zone, the supplier should obtain
                and retain the relevant Customs documents reflecting the movement of the goods from the designated zone.
            </p>

            <p>The supplier will also be required to retain commercial <u>or</u> official evidence that the goods were
                delivered to a place outside the UAE.</p>

            <p>If the above conditions are met, the place of supply of the goods will be outside the UAE and, therefore,
                outside the scope of UAE VAT. If any of these conditions are not met, the place of supply would be in
                the UAE and within the scope of UAE VAT.</p>

            <p><i>3. Goods delivered in the UAE</i></p>
            <p>For this exclusion to apply, all of the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><p>the goods are moved from the designated zone to be delivered in the UAE; and</p></li>
                <li><p>the supplier retains official evidence proving that the goods were imported as well as evidence that
                    VAT has been paid on that import.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>In instances where the goods will be moved from the designated zone to be delivered in the UAE,
                consumption would generally be regarded as taking place in the UAE. In this instance, VAT would also be
                levied on the importation of the goods, resulting in potential double taxation. Hence, the Executive
                Regulation was amended to allow such supplies to be regarded as having a place of supply outside the
                UAE, provided certain requirements are met.</p>

            <p>In order to treat such supply as outside the scope of UAE VAT, the supplier will be required to retain
                official evidence proving that the goods were imported as well as evidence that VAT has been paid on
                that import.</p>

            <p>In this context, the term "official evidence" refers to import documents issued by the local Emirate
                Customs Department in respect of the goods entering the UAE, for example stamped import declarations.
            </p>

            <p>It is acknowledged that the import may take place after the goods are sold, and that it would be
                impractical in such a case to obtain the proof of import and payment before the goods are actually
                imported.</p>

            <p>The supplier may, therefore, treat such sale as outside the scope of UAE VAT, if it has proof that the
                goods will be imported into the UAE. This would include instances where the supplier is responsible to
                import and deliver the goods to an address in the UAE.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the registered supplier shall retain proof that the goods were imported and that VAT was
                settled on the import before submitting the VAT return for the tax period in which the sale was made in
                order to treat the sale as outside the scope of UAE VAT.</p>

            <p>If any of the above conditions are not met, the sale of goods for consumption shall be treated as being
                within the scope of UAE VAT and subject to VAT at 5%, unless it qualifies for zero-rating, as well as
                subject to import VAT.</p>

            <p><i>Shipping and delivery services</i></p>
            <p>Under the general rule, the place of supply of any service supplied in a designated zone is considered to
                be in the UAE.</p>

            <p>As an exception to the general rule, shipping or delivery services supplied directly in connection with
                Qualifying Goods will be outside the scope of UAE VAT if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><p>The shipping or delivery service is supplied by the same supplier of the goods;</p></li>
                <li><p>The supplier of such goods is a non-resident, and not registered for VAT in the UAE;</p></li>
                <li><p>The goods are sold via an electronic sales platform; and</p></li>
                <li><p>The supplier of the goods is not the person owning the electronic sales platform.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The term "electronic sales platform" means any type of online sales platform, including websites and
                electronic applications, which bring together third-party sellers and buyers and through which goods may
                be sold and purchased with or without shipping or delivery services.</p>

            <p>The impact of this amendment is that non-residents who are not registered for VAT in the UAE will not be
                required to register for VAT if they only sell the goods to which the abovementioned exceptions apply,
                on an electronic sales platform, and they ship or deliver these goods to customers.</p>

            <p>Persons to whom Private Clarifications were issued from the FTA in relation to Article 51 of the
                Executive Regulation should consider the impact of the abovementioned amendments and may apply for new
                private clarifications, where applicable.</p>
