                    <h3>Issue</h3>
                    <p>Article 69 of Federal Decree-Law No. (8) of 2017 (&ldquo;VAT Decree-Law&rdquo;) requires that where a supply 
                        was made in a currency other than UAE Dirham that the amount stated on the issued tax invoice should 
                        be converted into the UAE Dirham according to the exchange rate approved by the UAE Central Bank at 
                        the date of supply.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>The UAE Central Bank began publishing exchange rates on 17 May 2018. Businesses are required by the 
                        VAT Decree-Law to use this exchange rate on any tax invoice issued in a currency other than the UAE Dirham 
                        from this date onwards.</p>
                    <p>Any tax invoices issued in a foreign currency prior to 17 May 2018 should have been converted to UAE 
                        Dirham using a reliable source for exchange rates. Provided this is the case, and the same source has been 
                        used consistently, there will be no need to rework tax invoices issued prior to 17 May 2018 where they do 
                        not use the UAE Central Bank exchange rate.</p>

                    <h3>Detailed Discussion</h3>
                    <h4>Tax invoices issued prior to 17 May 2018</h4>
                    <p>Where a tax invoice was issued prior to 17 May 2018 in a currency other than UAE Dirham, the tax invoice 
                        should have been converted to UAE Dirham using an exchange rate from a reliable source.</p>
                    <p>The source used to obtain the exchange rate should have been consistently used by the business for all 
                        tax invoices issued in foreign currencies during the period from 1 January to 16 May 2018.</p>
                    <h4>Examples of reliable exchange rate sources include, but are not limited to:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thomson Reuters</li>
                        <li>Oanda</li>
                        <li>The exchange rate published by a UAE bank</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Use of Historical Rates Published by the Central Bank</h3>
                    <p>The UAE Central Bank has also published on 17 May 2018, historical rates on its website, for periods 
                        prior to that date. There is no requirement for businesses to reissue historical tax invoices from 
                        periods prior to 17 May 2018 to show the Central Bank exchange rate, provided the exchange rate 
                        used is from a reliable source and the same source has been used consistently.</p>
                    <p>In the event a tax invoice is issued post 17 May 2018 but where the date of supply was prior to 
                        17 May 2018, businesses should use the historical rates as published by the Central Bank.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Use of Exchange Rates from 17 May 2018 Onwards</h3>
                    <p>Where a tax invoice is issued from 17 May 2018 onwards, it is required that the exchange rate 
                        published by the UAE Central Bank is used to convert the foreign currency to the UAE Dirham.</p>
                    <p>Businesses must use the exact exchange rate as published by the UAE Central Bank, which includes 
                        using the same number of decimal places as published.</p>
                    <p>For example, if the exchange rate for US Dollars is published as 3.672500, the full exchange rate 
                        should be used for the purposes of the tax invoice, and it is not permitted to round the exchange 
                        rate to fewer decimal places e.g. 3.7.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Time of Publication of Exchange Rates</h3>
                    <p>The UAE Central Bank updates the exchange rates on its website each day on or after 6pm, to cover 
                        the rate applicable for that day. Where a tax invoice is issued prior to 6pm on any given day, it will 
                        be acceptable to use the exchange rate published on the UAE Central Bank website at the time the 
                        tax invoice is raised, i.e. the rate for the day before.</p>

                    <h3>Use of Exchange Rates for Imports of Services</h3>
                    <p>Where businesses import services from foreign suppliers which are subject to VAT under the 
                        reverse charge mechanism, the invoice received for the supply is likely to be in a foreign currency. 
                        For the purposes of applying the reverse charge mechanism to such imports, businesses should use 
                        the UAE Central Bank exchange rate applicable on the date of supply in order to calculate the VAT 
                        liability to be reported in the VAT return.</p>
                    <p>A foreign supplier, not VAT registered in the UAE, is likely to issue an invoice which is not a tax invoice 
                        for UAE VAT purposes. It is acceptable to use the date of the invoice as the date of supply of the 
                        imported service and use the exchange rate applying as per that date.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Use of Exchange Rates for Imports of Goods</h3>
                    <p>Where goods are imported into the UAE, the VAT due on import shall be automatically calculated 
                        based on the import declarations submitted via the relevant Customs Department. This value is 
                        automatically populated in Box 6 of the VAT return.</p>
                    <p>Where invoices for imported goods are received in a foreign currency, the Customs department 
                        shall convert the value to UAE Dirham for the purposes of the import declaration. Where the 
                        Customs exchange rate used differs from the UAE Central Bank exchange rate, businesses shall be 
                        permitted to use the exchange rate applied by the Customs department for the purposes of declaring 
                        the VAT due on import.</p>
                    <p>There shall not be a requirement for businesses to convert the value of the import based on the 
                        UAE Central Bank rate and declare any adjustment due to exchange rate used within Box 7 of the 
                        VAT return.</p>

                    <h3>Public Clarification</h3>
                    <p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify certain aspects related to the 
                        implementation of the Federal Law No 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No 8 of 2017 
                        on Value Added Tax and their Executive Regulations.</p>

                        provision of the aforementioned legislation. Therefore, it is effective as of the date of implementation 
                        of the relevant legislation, unless stated otherwise.</p>
