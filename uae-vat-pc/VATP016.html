        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on the circumstances, a provider of healthcare services may be contractually supplying
          these services to another provider of healthcare services.</p>

        <p>
          For example, a doctor may have contracted with a hospital to provide certain healthcare services
          from the hospital&apos;s premises. Alternatively, a hospital may have contracted with a laboratory or
          another hospital for conducting tests or medical procedures for the
          hospital&apos;s patients.</p>

        <p>The
          question is whether such business-to-business healthcare services are eligible for zero-rating.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          A supply of healthcare services may only be zero- rated if the recipient of the supply is also the
          person who receives the treatment.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
        <em>VAT
          treatment of healthcare services:</em>

        <p>Most goods
          and services supplied in the UAE by a taxable
          person are subject to VAT at 5%.</p>

        <p>
          In accordance with Article 41 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the
          Federal Decree-Law No 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;Executive Regulations&rdquo;), healthcare services
          may be zero-rated if certain conditions are met. For the purposes of the Article, &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo; are
          defined as:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;any Service supplied that is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for
          <b>the treatment of the Recipient of the supply</b> including preventive treatment.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The above definition makes it clear that the <b>recipient of the supply </b>must also be the patient
          that receives the treatment. Where the patient and the recipient of the supply are not the same
          person, the services should therefore be subject to VAT at 5%.</p>

        <p>
          As a consequence, where a supply of services is made by a healthcare provider, the provider has to
          consider who the recipient of the supply is in order to be able to determine if the supply shall be
          zero-rated.</p>

        <p>
          In determining the identity of the recipient of the supply, the starting point should be to consider
          the contractual position between the parties and, specifically, who is <em>contractually</em> entitled
          to the services
          supplied. Thus, although the contractual agreements between parties are not always conclusive in determining
          the direction of a supply, they
          should in most circumstances be taken as reflective of the economic and commercial reality of the
          supply (unless the contractual terms are so artificial that they do not reflect the reality of the
          transaction).</p>

        <p>
          It should also be noted that the facts that a person may have initiated the supply, may have some
          interest in the supply, or is required to pay for the supply, are not in themselves determinative
          that the person in question is the recipient of the supply.</p>

        <em>Examples:</em>
        <p>
          Below are some of the examples of the application of the zero-rating provision to different
          healthcare scenarios. These examples are for indicative purposes only, and each supplier should
          consider the application of the VAT rules to their individual circumstances.</p>


        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
            <p>
              A doctor has contracted with a hospital to see patients who visit the hospital:</p>
            <p>
              1st Supply: The doctor is providing services to the hospital. Even though the services benefit, and
              relate to the health of, patients, they are not &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo; within the meaning of Article
              41(1) of the Executive Regulations because
              the doctor&apos;s contractual obligations are to the
              hospital. As a consequence, the services cannot be zero-rated.</p>
            <p>
              2nd Supply: the hospital is providing &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo; within the meaning of Article 41(1) of
              the Executive Regulations to the patients and therefore these can be zero- rated.</p>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <p>
              A hospital refers a patient to a laboratory for a medical test. The patient enters into a
              separate agreement with the laboratory for the
              supply of the medical test.</p>

            <p>
              Although the patient was referred to the laboratory by the hospital, the laboratory makes a supply
              directly to the patient. As a consequence, the supply of services by the laboratory falls within the
              definition of &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo; in Article 41(1) of the Executive Regulations.</p>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

            <p>
              A hospital is required to perform a specialised procedure for its patient. The hospital contracts
              with another hospital to perform the procedure.</p>

            <p>
              1st Supply : The specialist hospital provides its specialist services to the hospital which is
              treating the patient. Since the recipient of this supply
              is not the patient, the services are not &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo; and the supply cannot be zero-rated.
            </p>

            <p>
              2nd Supply: The hospital which is treating the patient is providing zero-rated &ldquo;healthcare services&rdquo;
              to the patient.</p>
