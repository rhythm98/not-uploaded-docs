        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>
          A natural or legal person may own a number of sole establishments. There has been uncertainty on
          whether each sole establishment needs to obtain a separate VAT registration or whether all such
          establishments should be included under one VAT registration.</p>

        <p>
          This Public Clarification clarifies the VAT registration obligations of a person in respect of its
          sole establishments. Note that the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; refers to a natural or legal person. <sup>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          A person owning a number of sole establishments should obtain only one VAT registration for all its
          sole establishments, and it is not permissible to register each sole establishment separately for VAT.</p>
        <p>
          The Federal Tax Authority (&apos;FTA&apos;) will review, in certain cases, the VAT registrations by taxable
          persons in respect of sole establishments and will inform them of the corrective steps to be taken,
          if any.</p>

        <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
        <em>Meaning of
          Sole Establishment</em>
        <p>
          A sole establishment (also referred to as sole proprietorship) is a form of business which is 100%
          owned by a person. A sole establishment does not have a legal personality that is independent of its
          owner, and is accordingly considered to be the same person as its owner. It should be noted that,
          for VAT purposes, a One-Person Company LLC or other similar entities are not considered sole
          establishments, and are seen as a distinct and separate legal person from their owner (unless the
          relevant applicable legislation state otherwise).</p>

        <em>VAT registration obligations of Sole Establishments</em>
        <p>A
          person may own a number of sole establishments, which may undertake different lines of business.</p>
        <p>
          On the basis that a sole establishment does not have a legal personality that is independent or
          different from its owner, and that each person can obtain only one VAT
          registration, it is hereby clarified that a person should include all its sole establishments under one VAT
          registration.
          Therefore, separate VAT registrations should not be sought for the different sole establishments of the same
          owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The VAT registration in such cases should be obtained ideally in the name of the person that owns
          the sole establishment(s). However, if a person owning multiple sole establishments, wishes to
          obtain the VAT registration in the name of one of its sole establishments instead, the person may apply to the
          FTA accordingly.</p>

        <p>
          It is important to note that the taxable supplies by a person as well as his sole establishments,
          must be considered collectively in order to determine the VAT registration obligations.</p>

        <em>Review of previous VAT registrations of sole establishments</em>

        <p>The FTA
          notes that there are some instances where a person
          may have received separate VAT registrations for different sole establishments.</p>

        <p>
          The FTA wishes to state that it will review such VAT registrations in certain cases and inform the
          relevant registrants of the corrective steps they should take, if any. It should be noted that, for
          any VAT registrations received in the past, no action is required to amend the VAT registrations,
          until specifically directed by
          the FTA. For all future VAT registration applications, the applicants must conform to the position stated in
          this Public Clarification.</p>

        <p>
          For the avoidance of doubt, please note that, if a person owns one or more sole establishments, the
          value of supplies made by the person and all its sole establishments must be aggregated to assess
          whether the VAT registration threshold has been exceeded.</p>

        <p>
          Consequently, if a registrant disregarded any of his sole establishments or his own taxable supplies
          for VAT purposes (for example, on the basis that the sole establishment or his taxable supplies did
          not reach the VAT registration threshold on a stand- alone basis), the registrant is required to
          inform the FTA of any undeclared output tax by submitting a voluntary disclosure. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>
          If the person and his sole establishments failed to register for VAT, even though the aggregate
          value of supplies listed in Article 19 of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added
          Tax <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup> made by the person and his sole establishment(s) exceeded the
          mandatory registration threshold of AED375,000, the person will be required to notify the FTA and
          corrective action must be taken to account for the
          outstanding VAT.</p>

          <em>
            This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify
            certain aspects related to the implementation of the Federal
            Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No.
            8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and their Executive Regulations.
            This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and
            neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of the
            aforementioned legislation. Therefore, it is effective as of the

            stated otherwise.

              assessment sent to him by the Authority is incorrect, which resulted in calculating the payable

              person shall, in this case, apply to correct such tax return by submitting a voluntary
