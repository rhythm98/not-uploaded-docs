            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>
                Article 53 of Cabinet Decision No. (52) of 2017 on
                the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law
                No. (8) of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT Executive
                Regulations&rdquo;) stipulates input tax which is non-
                recoverable by businesses (which, in most cases,
                will mean Taxable Persons).
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of circumstances in which
                businesses have sought clarity over the definition of
                &lsquo;entertainment&rsquo; for the purposes of the input tax
                restriction, and in particular what should constitute
                entertainment of staff or business contacts as
                opposed to incidental business-related expenses
                which would be recoverable under normal VAT
                rules.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This Public Clarification explains the application of
                Article 53 of the VAT Executive Regulations with
                regards to VAT which is non-recoverable in respect
                of entertainment or hospitality of any kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                VAT incurred on any costs which are used for a
                genuine business purpose, or which are incidental
                to a business purpose e.g. food and drink provided
                during a business meeting, shall be recoverable
                (subject to normal VAT recovery rules). However,
                where the hospitality provided becomes an end in
                itself and could be construed as the purpose for
                attending an event, such costs will be considered to
                be entertainment in nature and the VAT incurred
                shall not be recoverable. More information on how
                to define whether costs are incidental to a business
                purpose, or considered to be an end in themselves,
                is provided below.
            </p>
            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <h3>Entertainment provided to non-employees</h3>
            <p><i>Designated Government entities:</i></p>
            <p>
                Article 53(1)(a) of the Executive Regulations
                specifies that a Designated Government Entity
                (which is specified in a Cabinet Decision) is able to
                provide entertainment services to anyone not
                employed by the entity and shall be able to recover
                the input tax incurred on those costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This exception for Designated Government Entities
                only applies to entertainment provided to non-
                employees. For example, the following forms of
                entertainment would be considered to be in the
                course of the activities of the Designated
                Government Entity and any VAT incurred should be
                recoverable:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        meetings with delegations from other
                        countries where lunch or dinner is
                        provided;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        meetings with representatives from other
                        Government entities to discuss official
                        business, where refreshments are
                        provided;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        ceremonies held to mark significant
                        political events e.g. the signing of an
                        international agreement, where
                        entertainment is provided to the audience.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                See below for further comments on entertainment
                services provided to employees.
            </p>
            <p><i>VAT registrants who are not Designated Government Entities:</i></p>
            <p>
                Input Tax shall be non-recoverable if it is incurred
                by a person in respect of entertainment services
                provided to anyone not employed by the person
                (see below for further comments on entertainment
                services provided to employees), including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>customers;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>potential customers;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>officials; or</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>shareholders, or other owners or investors.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a result, where a VAT registrant who is not a
                Designated Government Entity provides
                entertainment services to any non-employee, the
                VAT incurred on such costs shall be blocked from
                recovery in full.
            </p>
            <p>
                This rule shall apply even where the business makes
                fully taxable supplies and would otherwise have the
                right to full input tax recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Entertainment services are defined under Article
                53(2) of the Executive Regulations as &ldquo;hospitality of
                any kind&rdquo; including the provision of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>accommodation;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>food and drinks which are not provided in a
                        normal course of a meeting; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>access to shows or events, or trips provided
                        for the purposes of pleasure or
                        entertainment.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Entertainment provided to employees</h3>
            <p>
                Where goods or services are purchased by any
                person to be used by employees for no charge to
                them and for their personal benefit, including the
                provision of entertainment services, then the VAT
                incurred on the cost is not recoverable unless an
                exception applies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that any entity, including Designated
                Government Entities, which provide entertainment
                services to employees are prevented from
                recovering any VAT included on such costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only circumstances in which a taxable person is
                entitled to recover VAT on such costs are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        where it is a legal obligation to provide
                        those services or goods to those employees
                        under any applicable labour law in the UAE
                        or Designated Zone in which the entity is;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        it is a contractual obligation or documented
                        policy to provide those services or goods to
                        those employees in order that they may
                        perform their role and it can be proven to
                        be normal business practice in the course
                        of employing those people; or
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        where the provision of goods or services is
                        a deemed supply under the provisions of
                        the Decree-Law.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For example, where a new employee joins a
                business and is provided with hotel
                accommodation for a short initial period prior to
                finding their own accommodation, this would not
                be considered entertainment and the VAT incurred
                on such costs would be recoverable, as this cost is
                necessary for the person to perform their role.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, where a business organizes a lunch or
                dinner for employees e.g. a Ramadan Iftar, this
                would be considered to be entertainment and the
                VAT incurred on such costs would be blocked from
                recovery.
            </p>
            <h3>Definition of entertainment services</h3>
            <p><i>Food and drinks &ldquo;in the normal course of a meeting&rdquo;</i></p>
            <p>
                The FTA considers that certain hospitality and
                entertaining expenses should be classed as normal
                business expenses which should not give rise to
                non-recoverable input tax under Article 53.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where simple hospitality is provided in the normal
                course of a business meeting e.g. where simple
                food and refreshments are provided during the
                course of a meeting, the cost is considered to be
                recoverable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FTA considers the following criteria is indicative
                of simple hospitality provided during a business
                meeting:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>the hospitality is provided at the same
                        venue as the meeting;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        if the meeting is interrupted, only by a short
                        break for the provision of the hospitality
                        and then resumes as normal e.g. a lunch
                        break;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the cost per head of providing the
                        hospitality does not exceed any internal
                        policy the business normally has in place
                        around employee subsistence claims,
                        where available;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the food and beverage provided is not
                        accompanied by any form of entertainment
                        e.g. a motivational speaker, a live band etc.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, where the food and refreshments are
                considered to be so substantial that they would
                constitute an end in themselves and may have
                encouraged someone to attend the meeting, the
                input tax incurred is non-recoverable. For example,
                a gala dinner event with a short introduction by a
                speaker would not be considered to be food and
                beverage in the normal course of a business
                meeting and the input tax incurred on costs would
                be blocked from recovery, where no charge is made
                for attendance.
            </p>
            <p><i>Conference and Business events:</i></p>
            <p>
                Recoverability of input tax in respect of costs
                incurred for catering services during conferences
                and business events would be dependent on
                whether any fee is charged from the attendees, as
                detailed below:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Where a fee is charged and VAT is
                        accounted on the same, the input tax
                        incurred on catering services would be
                        recoverable on the basis that the expense
                        is attributable to making taxable supplies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Where no fee is charged, the input tax
                        related to catering services will be blocked
                        as this situation will fall within the scope of
                        Article 53(1)(a) of the Executive
                        Regulations.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Where the business cannot establish or is uncertain
                whether or not hospitality is provided in the normal
                course of business meeting, it should refrain from
                recovering input tax on the expenses.
            </p>
            <p><i>Sundry office expenses:</i></p>
            <p>
                The FTA considers that certain normal incidental
                office expenses for general use by both employees
                and visitors does not give rise to non-recoverable
                input tax under Article 53.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of sundry office expenses on which the
                FTA accepts a business should be entitled to input
                tax recovery include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        tea and coffee available in the office or
                        provided during meetings for general use
                        by employees and non-employees for no
                        charge;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        flowers for display in receptions, offices or
                        for decoration during special events;

                </li>
                <li>

                        during meetings for general use by

                Where events are held purely for the purposes of
                entertaining staff, for example staff parties, the VAT
                incurred on the associated costs shall be blocked
                from recovery unless a charge is made to the
                employee for attending.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taxable Persons may also purchase goods or
                services to be given away to staff free of charge, in
                order to reward them for long service, for example.
                Based on the provisions of Article 53, the VAT
                incurred on such costs should be blocked from
                recovery.

                Examples of the type of gifts given away free of
                charge on which VAT recovery would normally be
                prevented (unless the business accounts for a
                deemed supply) would include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>long service awards;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>retirement gifts;</p>

                    <p>Eid gifts, or gifts for other festivals or
                        special occasions;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>gifts given on the occasion of a wedding or
                        birth of a child;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>employee of the month gifts; or</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>a dinner to reward service.</p>

            <p><i>Employee expenses:</i></p>
            <p>
                There will also be circumstances where a taxable
                person will fund or reimburse an employee for
                certain costs which the employee incurs for
                business purposes, in the course of performing
                their role. In such cases, the costs are considered to
                be genuine business expenses and the VAT incurred
                is recoverable where a tax invoice is provided and
                the cost is for business purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of costs incurred by an employee which
                the FTA considers should be recoverable by the
                business (subject to normal VAT recovery rules)
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        where an employee is on a domestic
                        business trip and requires overnight
                        accommodation, the VAT incurred on e.g.
                        hotel costs; or</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        input tax incurred on subsistence costs e.g.
                        food and drinks purchased by the
                        employee for their own consumption
                        during the business trip.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If the employee incurs costs which are related to
                entertaining a current/potential customer/supplier
                then any associated input tax incurred will be non-
                recoverable.
