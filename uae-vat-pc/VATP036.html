        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>Banks and exchange houses (collectively referred to as financial institutions) may only recover VAT imposed
          on international bank charges from banking institutions outside the UAE to the extent such costs are incurred
          to make taxable supplies and provided the financial institutions obtain and retain the required supporting
          documents.</p>
        <p>In practice, such international bank charges and their underlying transactions are evidenced by SWIFT
          messages which do not meet the requirements to constitute tax invoices for UAE VAT purposes.</p>
        <p>This Public Clarification clarifies the Federal Tax Authority&apos;s (FTA) position on the acceptability of SWIFT
          messages for documentation requirements and to support input tax recovery.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>As taxable persons, when financial institutions receive interbank services from non-resident banks, they are
          regarded as making supplies to themselves in respect of these interbank services and are required to issue tax
          invoices to themselves in respect of these supplies.</p>
        <p>Financial institutions shall also be responsible for all other applicable tax obligations and to account for
          the due tax.</p>
        <p>Financial institutions may only recover the related input tax to the extent the cost is incurred to make
          taxable supplies and provided that the required supporting tax invoices are obtained and retained.</p>
        <p>Considering the volumes of SWIFT messages UAE financial institutions receive on a daily basis, it would be
          impractical to require financial institutions to issue a tax invoice to themselves for each SWIFT transaction.
        </p>
        <p>Provided the SWIFT message contains sufficient information to establish the particulars of the supply, UAE
          financial institutions are not required to issue a tax invoice to themselves in respect of interbank services
          received from a non-resident bank and for which such SWIFT communication has been received.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions are entitled to recover input tax to the extent the cost was incurred for the purpose
          of making taxable supplies. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>The input tax may then be deducted through the tax return relating to the first tax period in which the
          financial institution received the tax invoice in respect of the supply and pays the consideration or part
          thereof.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Receipt of Concerned Services</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions incur international bank charges from banking institutions outside the UAE as a result
          of using the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) communication system with
          these non-resident banks.</p>
        <p>The provision of the right to use the SWIFT communication service constitutes a service for VAT purposes.</p>
        <p>If this service is received by a financial institution that is a resident of the UAE, according to the
          general place of supply rule, the place of supply is in the UAE. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>Consequently, where such service is received from outside the UAE, it constitutes a concerned service <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup> for UAE
          VAT purposes.</p>
        <p>As a taxable person, the financial institution is regarded as making a taxable supply to itself when it
          imports such concerned service, and is responsible for all applicable VAT obligations and accounting for VAT
          on the service. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a>
          </sup></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Issuing Tax Invoices</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions that are registered for VAT in the UAE are required to issue and deliver an original
          tax invoice to the recipient of taxable services supplied by the financial institution. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>This means that the financial institution is required to issue a valid tax invoice, to itself as recipient of
          the supply, in respect of each SWIFT transaction for which it incurs interbank charges.</p>
        <p>However, Article 59(7)(b) of the Executive Regulation <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a>
          </sup> provides that, where there are (or will be) sufficient
          records available to establish the particulars of any supply or class of supplies, and that it would be
          impractical to require the issuance of a tax invoice by the taxable person, the FTA may determine that a tax
          invoice is not required to be issued in certain cases.</p>
        <p>Considering the administrative burden to issue tax invoices to itself for a high number of SWIFT-related
          concerned services, the FTA recognises the impracticality for financial institutions to issue tax invoices in
          respect of international bank charges incurred from non-resident banking institutions as a result of using the
          SWIFT communication system with these non-resident banks. Therefore, the SWIFT message will be accepted as a
          sufficient record to establish the particulars of the supply, provided the following information is reflected
          on the SWIFT message:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Name and address of the non-resident bank (SWIFT sender/supplier)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Name of the UAE financial institution receiving the service (SWIFT receiver/customer)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Date of the transaction</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>SWIFT message reference number</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Transaction reference number</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Description of the transaction</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Consideration charged and currency used</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the above requirements are met, the SWIFT message (&ldquo;Qualifying SWIFT message&rdquo;) would be accepted as
          sufficient documentary evidence to prove the supply of the interbank service received from the non-resident
          bank, and the UAE financial institution shall be considered as having supplied the service to itself.</p>
        <p>Considering the above, a UAE financial institution is not required to issue a tax invoice to itself if it
          retains the relevant Qualifying SWIFT message as evidence of the transaction.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Input Tax Recovery</h3>
        <p>Financial institutions are eligible to recover VAT incurred to the extent such costs are incurred to make
          taxable supplies.</p>
        <p>The input tax may be recovered in the first tax return, or the immediately following tax period, in which the
          financial institution obtained the relevant supporting document and made payment or intends to make payment
          within 6 months of the agreed date for payment. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a>
          </sup> For more information on the timeframe for recovering input
          tax, please refer to VATP017.</p>
        <p>For purposes of input tax recovery, considering the nature of the Qualifying SWIFT message, it is accepted as
          sufficient documentary evidence to support the recovery of input tax that relates to this specific imported
          service. The recovery of input tax is subject to the other normal VAT recovery rules. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark8' id='bookmarkback8'>[8]</a>

          making a taxable supply to himself, and shall be
