            <p>
                Registrants are required to report their standard
                rated supplies per Emirate in the relevant box 1 of
                their VAT returns. This requires them to keep
                records of their transactions to prove in which
                Emirate the supply was made<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="footnoteback1">[1]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the general rule, supplies should be
                reported in the Emirate in which the taxable
                person&rsquo;s establishment that is most closely related
                to the supply, is located.

                Cabinet Decision No. 99 of 2022 on the
                Amendment of Some Provisions of Cabinet
                Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive
                Regulation of Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on
                Value Added Tax has amended Article 72 of the
                Executive Regulation, and requires certain taxable
                persons to report, and keep records of e-
                commerce transactions according to the Emirate
                in which these supplies are received.
            </p>
            <p>
                In accordance with the new amendment to Article
                72 of the Executive Regulation, the Ministerial
                Decision No. 26 of 2023 on the Criteria and
                Conditions for Electronic Commerce for the
                Purposes of Keeping Records of the Supplies
                Made, was issued, which is discussed in further
                detail in this Public Clarification.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Public Clarification provides guidance on how
                to determine which persons fall outside the
                general rule and for what supplies that are
                considered taxable supplies made through
                electronic commerce, and in which Emirate these
                supplies shall be reported in Box 1 of the VAT
                return.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Taxable persons supplying goods and services
                through electronic commerce which exceed AED
                100 million over a calendar year are referred to as
                &ldquo;Qualifying Registrants&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1 July 2023, Qualifying Registrants are
                required to report supplies made through e-
                commerce in box 1 of the VAT Return based on the
                Emirate in which the supplies of the goods or
                services are received by the customer, and keep
                the relevant supporting evidence.
            </p>
            <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
            <p><i>General</i></p>
            <p>
                Registrants are required to report taxable supplies
                subject to VAT at the standard rate, made in each
                Emirate during a tax period, in the relevant box 1
                of the VAT return, covering the tax period in which
                the supply is made.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Qualifying Registrants, special rules have been
                introduced to determine the Emirate against
                which e-commerce supplies are to be recorded
                and reported for VAT purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of Emirates&rsquo; reporting, the term
                &ldquo;e-commerce&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the process of selling
                goods or services through electronic means, an
                electronic platform, a store in social media, or
                electronic applications in accordance with criteria
                and conditions determined by the Minister&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p><i>Electronic means, an electronic platform, a store in
                    social media, or electronic applications</i></p>
            <p>
                Electronic means, an electronic platform, a store
                in social media, or electronic applications are
                included under the definition of &ldquo;Electronic
                Commerce Medium&rdquo; whereby this definition
                further covers a website, portal, gateway,
                interface, platform, marketplace, API and similar
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electronic Commerce Medium therefore covers a
                broad range of concepts, such as stores in the
                metaverse, smart kiosks, robotic devices, etc.
            </p>
            <p><i>Electronic Commerce supply made through an
                    Electronic Commerce Medium</i></p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of the revised Emirates
                Reporting under Article 72(4) of the Executive
                Regulation, only taxable supplies made through
                electronic commerce shall be considered. Hence
                for the calculation of the threshold of one hundred
                million dirhams (exclusive of VAT) during the
                calendar year, only such taxable supplies shall be
                taken into account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Article 3 of the Ministerial Decision sets out the
                criteria and conditions for the supplies of goods or
                services to be considered as being supplied
                through an Electronic Commerce Medium. If all
                the criteria and conditions, as clarified below, are
                met, such supplies will be subject to the reporting
                rules as defined under Article 72(4) of the
                Executive Regulation subject to their annual value
                exceeding the threshold of one hundred million
                Dirhams per year:
            </p>
            <ul class="dashed">
                <li>
                    <p><i>The Goods and Services are listed or advertised
                            on the Electronic Commerce Medium</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This condition is met if the customer is
                        provided with sufficient information to allow
                        an informed purchase of the goods or services.
                        Listing or advertising general categories of
                        goods or services on the Electronic Commerce
                        Medium without individually listing or
                        advertising the goods or services falling under
                        such categories or without a price or cost,
                        does not meet with this condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, if the Electronic Commerce Medium
                        only provides for a link to another website
                        where the goods or services are listed or only
                        displays a QR code, this does not meet the
                        condition of goods or services being listed or
                        advertised on the Electronic Commerce
                        Medium.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The goods and services are ordered through
                        the Electronic Commerce Medium, regardless
                        of whether the payment is made online or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This condition requires the order to be fully
                        executed, through the use of the Electronic
                        Commerce Medium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if the customer is required to
                        sign a contract in person (offline) or separately
                        agree to terms and conditions on another
                        electronic medium or via email, for the order
                        to be confirmed, the condition will not be met
                        since the order will not be fully completed
                        through the electronic medium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The manner or form of payment is not a
                        determining factor for meeting this condition.
                        Payment for the electronic commerce supply
                        can be done through online means, separate
                        bank transfer, cash on delivery, or any other
                        commercially acceptable form of payment.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><i>In the case of a supply of goods, the goods are
                            delivered to a location specified by the
                            customer whereby this location is not owned
                            by the supplier nor operated by that supplier</i></p>
                    <p>
                        The delivery must be to a location specified by
                        the customer, whereby the location specified
                        by the customer will determine the Emirate in
                        which the supply is received for the purposes
                        of Article 72(4) of the Executive Regulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This condition will not be met where the
                        customer specifies any location owned or
                        operated by the supplier as the delivery
                        address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if the customer elects to collect
                        the goods from any of the supplier&rsquo;s locations
                        (e.g. stores or warehouses), such supply will
                        not be regarded as a supply through e-
                        commerce and should be disregarded when
                        assessing whether the supplier is a Qualifying
                        Registrant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the location is specified by the
                        customer, this shall be considered to
                        determine the Emirate in which the supply is
                        received. This takes precedence over, for
                        example place of residence or billing address
                        of the customer, if these are different from the
                        delivery location specified.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In the case of a supply of services, the services
                        are provided, or the right to receive the
                        services is granted to the customer with
                        minimal or no human intervention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This condition covers a supply of services
                        provided through the electronic medium on
                        which the services are advertised or listed and
                        through which the order was made. The
                        condition also covers the granting of the right
                        to receive services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The services or the granting of the right to
                        receive the services must be provided with
                        minimal or no human intervention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, where a training is provided by a
                        human lecturer through live-stream, such
                        service shall be disregarded in assessing
                        whether a supplier is a Qualifying Registrant.
                        However, if the training consists of the
                        automatic broadcasting of a pre-recorded
                        training course with an automated
                        assessment, the condition will be met and,
                        hence, this service should be considered in
                        assessing whether the supplier is a Qualifying
                        Registrant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another example is where the granting of the
                        right to receive services is provided through
                        the intervention of a chatbox, operated by a
                        human being in a call centre. In this case, the
                        condition is not met.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where an Electronic Commerce Medium
                        automatically grants the right to receive meal
                        delivery services, this condition will be met,
                        even though the delivery services are
                        performed by human drivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But if the customer merely checks the list of
                        goods or services on the Electronic Commerce
                        Medium and then calls or otherwise contacts
                        the supplier who delivers the goods, the
                        service of the transport is not considered to
                        have been received through the Electronic
                        Commerce Medium nor has the right to
                        receive it, been granted through the Electronic
                        Commerce Medium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the purposes of the requirement under
                        Article 72(4) of the Executive Regulation, the
                        Emirate in which the services are received,
                        shall be determined in accordance with the
                        relevant factors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a default factor, the FTA will accept the
                        place of residence, i.e. the residential address
                        of a consumer, or the establishment most
                        closely connected to the service for a business
                        customer, as the location where the services
                        are received, taking precedence over, for
                        example, billing address or IP address.

                name of the supplier of the relevant goods or
                services, it shall be regarded as an undisclosed
                agent.
            </p>
            <p>
                In such cases, the supplier shall be regarded as
                supplying the goods or services to the e-
                Commerce Medium, and the e-Commerce
                Medium shall be regarded as supplying the same

            <p>
                In such an arrangement, the operator of the e-

                account for VAT on the supply to the customer if
                the e-Commerce Medium is a taxable person,
                unless the supply is out of scope or exempt from
                VAT. Therefore, the operator of the e-Commerce
                Medium, and not the supplier, is required to
                consider the supply to the end customer when
                determining the value of the taxable supplies
                made by it through e-commerce.
            </p>
            <p>
                The supplier is required to consider the supply to

            <p><i>Threshold for Qualifying Registrants</i></p>
            <p>
                From 1 July 2023, Qualifying Registrants, including
                registrants acting as undisclosed agents, are
                required to notify the FTA via the first VAT return
                to be submitted after exceeding the AED
                100 million threshold. At notification, the
                Registrant is required to also confirm the date
                when the AED 100 million threshold was
                exceeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first assessment of whether the AED
                100 million threshold is exceeded is based on the
                2022 calendar year, i.e. 1 January 2022 to 31
                December 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the threshold was not exceeded for the calendar
                year 2022, the registrant making e-commerce
                supplies shall regularly conduct an assessment to
                determine whether the threshold of AED
                100 million was exceeded during any subsequent
                calendar years. The registrant shall notify the FTA
                through the first return submitted after the
                threshold was exceeded for any calendar year and
                confirm the date on which it exceeded the
                threshold.

                From 1 July 2023 or the first tax period following
                the calendar year in which the AED 100 million
                threshold was exceeded, as the case may be,
                Qualifying Registrants will be required to
                separately identify the Emirate in which e-
                commerce and non-e-commerce standard rated
                supplies are to be reported, per tax period. This
                information shall be submitted as an underlying
                declaration and split between e-commerce and
                non-e-commerce standard rated supplies.

                The amounts declared in each of the relevant

                the Emirate in which the goods or services were
                received. The FTA may require these documents

            <p>
                Once a registrant has been classified as a
                Qualifying Registrant and is subject to the related
                reporting obligations, it will be required to abide
                by the reporting mechanism clarified above for
                the following period(s):
            </p>
            <ul class="dashed">

                    <p>
                        (18) Eighteen months starting from the first
                        tax period commencing on or after 1 July 2023
                        for registrants that have exceeded the
                        AED 100 million threshold during the calendar

                        Two (2) years starting from the first tax period
                        of the calendar year commencing after the
                        date on which the registrant has exceeded
                        AED 100 million threshold for any year after
                        2022.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if the e-commerce supplier
                        exceeded the threshold for the first time in
                        October 2023, the relevant reporting
                        obligations start for the first tax period
                        starting in the calendar year 2024 and will
                        apply for a period of 2 years. In this case, if the
                        Qualifying Registrant&rsquo;s first tax period in 2024
                        starts on 1 February 2024, then the obligation
                        to report as per the above clarified
                        mechanism in relation to e-Commerce
                        supplies will apply until the tax period ending

            </ul>
            <p>
                At the end of the 18 months or 2 years, as the case
                may be, the Qualifying Registrant shall re-assess
                whether it exceeded the threshold for the
                calendar year that just ended, and notify the FTA
                accordingly through its tax return if it needs to
                continue applying the special reporting
                mechanism in relation to e-Commerce supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, where the Qualifying Registrant still
                exceeded the threshold in the calendar year 2025,
                the Qualifying Registrant shall inform the FTA
                again in the return submitted for the first tax
                period starting in the calendar year 2026. The
                qualifying registrant will then continue to apply
                the reporting mechanism as clarified in this Public
                Clarification for a further 2 years.
