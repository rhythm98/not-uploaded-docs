            <p>Under application of Article 3 of Cabinet Decision No. 91, a Ministerial Decision No. 262 of 2023 on the
                Criteria to be Followed to Determine of Pieces and Parts of Electronic Devices ("Ministerial Decision
                No. 262") has been issued.<sup><a href='#footnote2' id='footnoteback2'>[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>This public clarification should be read together with VATP034 on the Application of the Reverse Charge
                Mechanism on Electronic Devices among Registrants in the State for the purposes of Value Added Tax.</p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Article 3(1) of Ministerial Decision No. 262 states three criteria according to which pieces and parts
                will be considered to be related to Electronic Devices and fall within the scope of the VAT treatment
                and related compliance obligations implemented by Cabinet Decision No. 91.<sup><a href='#footnote3'
                        id='footnoteback3'>[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>The pieces and parts will be considered related to Electronic Devices if they meet one or more of the
                three criteria and do not fall within the exceptions stated in Article 3(2) of Ministerial Decision No.
                262.<sup><a href='#footnote4' id='footnoteback4'>[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Ministerial Decision No. 262 takes effect from the same day that Cabinet Decision No. 91 takes effect,
                i.e. on 30 October 2023.</p>
            <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
            <p>For its application, Cabinet Decision No. 91 has defined Electronic Devices as "Mobile phones, smart
                phones, computer devices, tablets and pieces and parts thereof".<sup><a href='#footnote5'
                        id='footnoteback5'>[5]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Ministerial Decision No. 262 sets the following three criteria to determine if pieces or parts are
                related to Electronic Devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The pieces and parts are normally used for the manufacturing or production of Electronic Devices
                        and they are necessary for the normal operation of the Electronic Devices.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The pieces and parts, even if not normally used for in the manufacturing or production process,
                        are normally necessary for the operation of Electronic Devices, such as chargers, power cords,
                        battery packs and other similar pieces and parts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The pieces and parts are a replacement for the pieces and parts meeting either of the previous
                        two criteria.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The criteria are to be considered separately from each other. It is possible that a piece or part does
                not fall under one criterion but, because of its characteristics, meets another criterion.</p>
            <h3>Criterion One &ndash; Normally used in the manufacturing or production and necessary for the normal
                operation</h3>
            <p>This criterion applies to all pieces and parts that are used in the manufacturing or production of mobile
                phones, smart phones, computer devices and tablets, the scope of which has been clarified in Public
                Clarification VATP034. It is also required that the pieces and parts are necessary for the normal
                operation of the devices.</p>
            <p>As examples, the pieces and parts that would meet this criterion would be the coils, capacitators,
                couplers, diodes, regulators, resistors, transistors, microchips and other such pieces and parts of
                smart phones, mobile phones and tablets. The criterion would also be met by, for example, for
                accelerometers, heart rate monitors, gyroscopes processors, etc. built into smart watches that are an
                extension of a smart phone or mobile phone or that can connect independently and directly to cellular
                networks ("Smart Watches") as such Smart Watches do fall within the definition of Electronic Devices
                under Cabinet Decision No. 91.</p>
            <p>Pieces and parts that are part of the hardware of a computer device are meeting the criterion, such as
                the CPU, RAM, hard drive, optical drive, network interface card, etc.</p>
            <p>To meet the criterion, the above pieces and parts must also be required for the normal operation of the
                devices. This is normally the case for all internal components of an Electronic Device, but would also,
                for example, include the keyboard of a portable computer device.</p>
            <p>External input devices, such as computer mice, external output devices, such as monitors and printers and
                secondary storage devices, such as external hard disks do not fall under this first criterion, since
                they are not normally used in the manufacturing or production of the Electronic Devices.</p>
            <p>Pieces and parts that may be used in the manufacturing or production but are not normally used or are not
                necessary for the normal operation of the Electronic Device, do not meet the criterion. This may be the
                case, for example, for the crystals or gold leaves applied on certain smart phones during the
                manufacturing process or jewelry elements applied to Smart Watches.</p>
            <h3>Criterion two &ndash; Pieces and Parts that are not normally used for the manufacturing or production of
                Electronic Devices, but are normally necessary for the normal operation of Electronic Devices</h3>
            <p>Article 3(1)(b) of Ministerial Decision No. 262 provides examples of pieces and parts that are considered
                to be necessary for the normal operation of Electronic Devices.<sup><a href='#footnote3'>[3]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst the Electronic Devices may operate normally for a certain amount of time without the use or
                application of such pieces and parts, their continuing normal operation can only be ensured with the use
                of the pieces and parts that meet this second criterion, such as chargers (whether wired or wireless).
            </p>
            <p>External monitors, mice and keyboards for desktop computers would be further examples of pieces and parts
                meeting this second criterion since they are necessary for the normal operation of such Electronic
                Devices.</p>
            <h3>Criterion Three &ndash; Replacement Pieces and Parts</h3>
            <p>Pieces and parts that meet the third criterion are those pieces and parts that are a replacement for any
                of the goods that meet either of the first two criteria.</p>
            <p>For example, and as clarified above, coils, capacitators, couplers, diodes, regulators, resistors,
                transistors, microchips and other such pieces and parts of smart phones, mobile phones and tablets, meet
                criterion one. Such pieces and parts are also classified as "replacement parts" that meet criterion
                three when separately supplied by a Registrant to another Registrant, who intends to resell these.</p>
            <h3>Exclusions</h3>
            <h3>Pieces and Parts that enhance the functioning or enjoyment of Electronic Devices, but are not necessary
                for the operation of the Electronic Devices or the activation of their features</h3>
            <p>Under the exclusion stated under Article 3(2)(a) of Ministerial Decision No. 262, pieces and parts that
                merely enhance the functioning or enjoyment of Electronic Devices, are considered not to be meeting the
                criteria to be related to Electronic Devices.<sup><a href='#footnote4' id='footnoteback4'>[4]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>This exclusion applies to external pieces and parts. Examples of such pieces and parts include but are
                not limited to external speakers, phone cases and covers, a keyboard with device cover combination for a
                tablet, headphones and earphones, screen protectors, selfie sticks, device holders, power adapters,
                pencils for tablets, projectors, USB sticks, dongles, etc.</p>
            <p>The supplier will need to consider the application of Article 4 of the Executive Regulation and assess if
                the supply constitutes a single composite supply for the application of Cabinet Decision No. 91.<sup><a
                        href='#footnote6' id='footnoteback6'>[6]</a></sup></p>
            <h3>SIM Cards and other external smart cards</h3>
            <p>Whilst Subscriber Identity Module ("SIM") cards and other smart cards of the same nature or with the same
                purpose are normally necessary for the normal operation of certain types of Electronic Devices, these
                are, however, explicitly excluded from the application of Ministerial Decision No. 262 and, hence from
                the application of Cabinet Decision No. 91.</p>
            <p>Smart cards of the same nature or with the same purpose are, for example, R-UIM cards, eSIMs, subscriber
                cards, etc.</p>
            <p>Also, when SIM and similar cards are supplied, the supplier will need to consider the application of
                Article 4 of the Executive Regulation and assess if the supply constitutes a single composite supply for
                the application of Cabinet Decision No. 91.<sup><a href='#footnote6'>[6]</a></sup></p>
            <h3>Final Comment</h3>
            <p>This Public Clarification intends to clarify the new legislation and the goods meeting the criteria. Any
                examples given in this Clarification are examples only and it remains the responsibility of the
                Registrants in the transaction to determine if goods supplied meet the criteria stated in Ministerial
                Decision No. 262 and, hence, whether the supply of these goods falls within the scope of the tax
                treatment defined in Cabinet Decision No. 91.</p>
