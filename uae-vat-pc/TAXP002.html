            <h3>Issue</h3>

            <p>On 28 April 2021, the Cabinet issued Decision No. 49 of 2021 on Amending some Provisions of Cabinet
                Decision No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws in the UAE ("Cabinet
                Decision No. 49 of 2021")<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="footnoteback1">[1]</a></sup>. Cabinet Decision
                No. 49 of 2021 amended some of the administrative penalties applicable to certain violations and allows
                for a redetermination of some of the penalties already imposed.</p>

            <p>This Public Clarification provides detailed information on the redetermination of some of the penalties
                already imposed.</p>

            <p>Details relating to the amendments to administrative penalties in accordance with the First Article of
                Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 are discussed in the Tax Procedures Public Clarification <i>"TAXP001 -
                    Amendments to the Penalties Regime"</i>, available on the FTA's website.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>

            <p>Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 provides for the ability to redetermine penalties imposed before its
                effective date (i.e. before 28 June 2021) where the penalties were imposed according to Cabinet Decision
                No. 40 of 2017 and certain conditions are met. This decision is applicable on all administrative
                penalties imposed as per Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 whether in respect of tax procedures, VAT or
                Excise Tax.</p>

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>

            <p><i>Background</i></p>

            <p>The UAE introduced Excise Tax and VAT with effect from 1 October 2017 and 1 January 2018, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>In order to offer consistency in the administration of different taxes, a set of common tax procedures
                concerning the rights and obligations of the FTA and taxpayers has been developed and prescribed in the
                Federal tax procedures legislation, including in Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures ("FTP
                Law"). These Federal tax procedures apply to all Federal taxes under the jurisdiction of the FTA.</p>

            <p>Article 25 of the FTP Law<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup> specifies a number of
                violations which are subject to administrative penalties. This Article also directs the Cabinet to issue
                a decision that specifies administrative penalties for each of the violations listed in the Article, on
                condition that each such penalty cannot be less than AED 500 for any violation and cannot exceed three
                times the amount of tax in respect of which the penalty was levied.</p>

            <p>The specific administrative penalties for each violation are prescribed in the Cabinet Decision No. 40 of
                2017, which was issued on 24 September 2017. These penalties have been applied to violations since the
                introduction of the VAT and Excise Taxes.</p>

            <p>On 28 April 2021, the Cabinet has issued the Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021, which amends some of the
                administrative penalties applicable on the violations stated in Tables appended to Cabinet Decision No.
                40 of 2017. Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 in its Third Article also included concessionary measures in
                respect of the administrative penalties imposed on them prior to the effective date of Cabinet Decision
                No. 49 of 2021.</p>

            <p><i>Redetermination of Administrative Penalties Imposed Prior to 28 June 2021</i></p>

            <p>As a concessionary measure aimed to help businesses, Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 gives the FTA
                ability to redetermine the amounts of unsettled payable administrative penalties, which were imposed on
                registrants on the basis of the penalty rules listed in Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017.</p>

            <p>To benefit from the redetermination, all of the following conditions have to be met:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Any of the administrative penalties set out in Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 have been imposed
                        on the person before 28 June 2021;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The person has not settled all the administrative penalties imposed on it as per Cabinet Decision
                        No. 40 of 2017 in full before 28 June 2021.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The taxable person has undertaken all of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Settled all payable tax, i.e. the registrant shall ensure that by 31 December 2021, no
                                payable tax is still outstanding whether such tax was payable before or after 28 June
                                2021, and that all such amounts have been received by the FTA by 31 December 2021; and
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Settled 30% of the total unsettled administrative penalties referenced above which were
                                imposed before 28 June 2021, no later than 31 December 2021.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Where the above conditions are met, the FTA will, at the end of 2021, redetermine that the administrative
                penalties payable and not settled by 28 June 2021 equal 30% of that unsettled part. Hence, the Person
                shall not be required to pay the remaining part (i.e. 70%).</p>

            <p><i>Examples</i></p>

            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
                    At beginning of April 2021, a penalty of AED 12,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet
                    Decision No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 2,000 of this penalty on 15 April 2021. On 28
                    June 2021, AED 10,000 penalties remain unsettled. The Registrant settled all payable tax including
                    that relating to the last return due in 2021 and 30% of the penalties unsettled (i.e. AED 3,000) by
                    31 December 2021. In this case, the Registrant qualified for redetermination, and the FTA
                    redetermined its penalties. Consequently, the Registrant will no longer be required to pay the
                    remaining AED 7,000 of the administrative penalties, and the administrative penalty imposed before
                    28 June 2021 shall equal AED 3,000 that was already settled by the Registrant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
                    At beginning of April 2021, a penalty of AED 12,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet
                    Decision No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 2,000 of this penalty on 15 April 2021. On 28
                    June 2021, AED 10,000 penalties remain unsettled. The Registrant settled 30% of the penalties
                    unsettled (i.e. AED 3,000) but did not settle all payable tax. In this case, the Registrant does not
                    qualify for redetermination as it has not settled all payable tax. Consequently, the Registrant is
                    still required to pay the remaining AED 7,000 of the administrative penalties.</p>
            </div>

            <p><i>Procedures Relating to the Redetermination of Administrative Penalties</i></p>

            <p>To facilitate the procedures for registrants, the FTA will link the redetermination process and the
                relevant data to the registrants' e-Services accounts. The registrants will be able to view further
                information relating to the process as of 28 June 2021.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify certain aspects related to the
                    implementation of Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 on Amending some Provisions of Cabinet Decision
                    No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws in the UAE. This Public
                    Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of
                    the aforementioned legislation. Therefore, it is effective as of the date of implementation of the
