                <h3>Issue</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Jewellers generally receive a consideration covering both the price of the Gold or Diamonds and the Making Service.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In practice, the gold/diamond price and the making charges may be shown separately or together on the tax invoice.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This Clarification explains the VAT treatment of Making Charges in light of the amendment to Cabinet Decision No. 25 of 2018.</p></li>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Tax registrants supplying Gold are not required to impose VAT on Gold and Gold-based products if conditions in Cabinet Decision No. 25 are met. Instead, a reverse charge mechanism applies, whereby the registered recipient accounts for VAT.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The definition of &quot;goods&quot; under Cabinet Decision No. 25 was amended to include Making Services directly related to Gold for the period from 1 June 2018 to 31 December 2022.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This allowed the reverse charge to be applied to such Making Services for that limited period.</p></li>
                    <li><p>From 1 January 2023, the reverse charge applies only to the supply of Gold and products where Gold is the principal component.</p></li>
                    <li><p>If Making Services are charged separately, VAT must be applied to the service portion from 1 January 2023.</p></li>

                <h3>Detailed Analysis</h3>
                <h5>Scope</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>This Clarification applies only to Gold and products that primarily consist of Gold and do not qualify for zero-rating. These are referred to as &quot;Gold Items&quot;.</p></li>
                    <li><p>From 1 June 2018 to 31 December 2022, reverse charge could be applied to Making Services supplied with and directly connected to Gold Items.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Making Services are considered directly connected if the service is performed on the Gold Item being supplied.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The export of Gold Items and the supply of investment precious metals do not qualify for the reverse charge and are outside the scope of this Clarification.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Tax registrants supplying Gold Items shall not impose VAT if the following conditions are met:</p>

                            <li>The recipient is registered for VAT.</li>
                            <li>The supplier retains a written declaration from the recipient confirming:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The recipient will use the Gold Item to produce/manufacture other Gold Items or resell it.</li>
                                    <li>The recipient is VAT registered on the date of supply.</li>
                                    <li>The recipient will account for the VAT on the Gold Item supplied.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Applies when a single price is charged for the Gold Item including Making Services and all these conditions are met:</p>

                            <li>The supply includes a principal component (Gold Item) and incidental services (e.g. Making Services).</li>

                            <li>Price is not separated.</li>
                            <li>The Gold and services are supplied by the same supplier.</li>

                    <li><p>Each component must be treated as a separate supply with appropriate tax treatment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Reverse charge applies only to the Gold Items if all conditions of Cabinet Decision No. 25 are met.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Supplier must apply standard VAT to services (e.g. Making Services) if they do not fall under reverse charge mechanism.</p></li>

                <h3>Determination of Supply Type (Composite vs. Multiple)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Article 4(1)</strong>: If a supply includes more than one component for a single price, the supplier must determine whether it is a single composite supply or multiple supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Article 4(2)</strong>: A single composite supply refers to a supply of goods or services with multiple components, determined by the overall contract and circumstances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Article 4(3)</strong>: A single composite supply exists when:
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a principal component.</li>
                            <li>Other components are either incidental or necessary, not significant by themselves, but enhance the main supply.</li>
                            <li>Or when components are closely linked and cannot naturally be separated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Article 4(4)</strong>: A composite supply may also exist when:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The price for all components is not separately charged.</li>
                            <li>All components are supplied by the same supplier.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Article 46(1)</strong>: If the supply qualifies as a composite supply, the tax treatment will follow that of the principal component.</li>
                    <li><strong>Article 4(5)</strong>: If a person supplies multiple components for one price but it’s not a composite supply, it will be treated as multiple supplies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Article 46(2)</strong>: In such cases, each component is treated as a separate supply, with its own tax treatment.</li>
