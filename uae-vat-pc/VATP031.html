        <p>Article 3 of the Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on
          the Executive Regulation of the Federal DecreeLaw No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;Executive
          Regulation&rdquo;) has been amended by Cabinet
          decision No. 99 of 2022, which introduced a new
          provision.</p>
        <p>
          Article 3(2) of the amended Executive Regulation states that the functions of a member of a Board of
          Directors (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Director&rdquo;), performed by a natural person, appointed as
          Director, for any Government entity or private sector establishment, shall not be considered as a supply of

        <p>
          This Public Clarification provides guidance on how to apply the new provision and determine the
          resulting VAT obligations prior and post the date of 01
          January 2023 on concerned natural persons.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>With effect from 01 January 2023, the performance of a Director&#39;s function by a natural person and for
          remuneration (monetary or in kind), on a Board of Directors of any government or private sector entity, shall
          not be considered a supply of services for VAT purposes.</p>
        <p>Prior to 01 January 2023, the general rule was that
          services provided by Directors, whether the
          function was performed by a natural person or a
          legal person, were considered to be services for
          VAT purposes.</p>
        <p>These
          supplies of services were taxable where:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
          <li>
            <p>the
              Director performed the services on a regular,
              ongoing, and independent basis, and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the total value of taxable supplies and imports made by the Director, not limited to but also
              including the Director services, exceeded the mandatory registration threshold.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
        <em>General</em>
        <p>For the provision of Directors&apos; services not to be considered as a supply of services for VAT
          purposes according to the amended Executive Regulation, the
          following conditions must be met:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
          <li>
            <p>The services are provided by a natural person.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The person is appointed as a director on a Board of any government entity or private Sector
              establishment.</p>

            <em>Natural Person</em>
            <p>
              Only Director services performed by natural persons, whether resident in the UAE or not, can be
              excluded from the qualification of &ldquo;supply of services
              for UAE VAT purposes&rdquo;.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This amendment does not extend to a legal person, whether private or public, who may delegate in its
          own name a natural person to act as Director.</p>

        <em>Board of Directors</em>
        <p>
          Only Director services performed as Director on a Board of Directors of a government entity or a
          private establishment can be excluded from the qualification of &ldquo;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&rdquo;.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other services provided by the member, are considered to be supplies of services for VAT purposes
          and may be taxable subject to meeting conditions for taxable supplies as stated in the VAT
          legislation. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a>
          </sup></p>

        <em>Capacity as Director</em>
        <p>Only
          the services performed in the formal capacity as Director can be excluded from the qualification of &ldquo;supply of
          services for
          UAE VAT purposes&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>For example,
          free-lance services rendered by a third-party
          natural person who is not a Director during the meetings of a Board of Directors are considered to be supplies
          of services for VAT
          purposes and will be taxable subject to meeting other
          conditions.</p>

        <p>
          In case the services are performed by Directors who are not resident in the UAE, these services will
          evidently also be excluded from the qualification of &ldquo;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&rdquo;.
          There will be no application of the reverse charge mechanism or need for the natural person to
          register in the UAE for VAT purposes.</p>

        <em>Transitional rules</em>
        <p>
          Natural persons performing the function(s) of a Director on a Board of Directors, as defined above,
          must review their tax obligations for the period both prior to and from 01 January 2023.</p>

        <p>The Date of Supply is
          governed by Articles 25 <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup> and 26 <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup>of the Executive Regulation. The rules laid down in
          these Articles will
          determine whether the performance of the function is deemed to take place
          before or from 01 January 2023.</p>
        <p>Examples for
          guidance:</p>
        <ul class="dashed">
          <li>
            <p>
              The natural person performs the function of Director for the calendar year 2022 whereby the Board
              fees for the year were determined and known with effect from 01 January 2022. No payments were
              released to the natural person
              during 2022 and no Tax invoices were issued.</p>
            <p>
              In this scenario, and in accordance with Article 25 Decree-Law, the date of supply will be the date
              of actual completion of the services, and the Director&apos;s services will fall within the scope of the
              UAE VAT legislation as a supply of services, regardless of whether payment was made in 2023 or not.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The natural person is appointed as Director for 2 consecutive calendar years, i.e., 2022 and 2023.
              The Board fees are fixed and known from the start of 2022 and automated payments are made on the
              first business day after the end of each calendar quarter (01 April 2022, 01 July 2022, 03 October
              2022, 02 January 2023, 03 April
              2023, 03 July 2023, 02 October 2023 and 02 January 2024). It is also agreed between the Director and the
              entity that the
              Director issues his/her tax invoice after receipt of the payment.</p>
            <p>
              The scenario at hand covers continuous Director services for 2 calendar years and with contractually
              agreed periodic payments. In accordance with Article 26 of the Decree-Law, the date of supply of
              services for any contract that includes periodic payments or consecutive invoices shall be the
              earliest of any of the following dates:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <p>The
                  date of issuance of any tax invoice.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The date payment is due as specified on the tax invoice.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The date of
                  receipt of payment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The date of expiration of one year from the date the goods or services were provided.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The
              date of supply shall be determined according to Article 26(1)(c) of the Decree-Law, i.e. the
              date of receipt of payment, being the earliest of the dates mentioned for the scenario at hand.</p>
            <p>
              Hence, the payments received on 01 April 2022, 01 July 2022 and 03 October 2022 will be considered
              as triggering the date of supply for Director&apos;s services that are within the scope of the UAE VAT
              legislation as a supply of services. The other payments (including the payment received on 02
              January 2023) will not fall within the scope of the UAE VAT legislation as a supply of services.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The natural person performs the functions of a Director for the calendar year 2022 but the fees
              allocated for that calendar year are only determined after the conclusion of the Annual General
              Meeting (&ldquo;AGM&rdquo;), to be held on 31 January 2023.</p>
            <p>
              If the natural person did not issue any invoice and did not receive any advance payment, the date of
              supply is the date on which the provision of the Director&apos;s services was completed, in accordance with
              Article 25 of the Decree-Law.</p>
            <p>
              The Director services are then deemed to be completed only when the Board fees are known upon
              conclusion of the AGM on 31 January 2023, despite the fact that the provision of the services may
              have been physically completed earlier. Hence, the Director&apos;s services provided by the natural
              person will not qualify as a supply of services for UAE VAT purposes.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For further guidance with determining the time of supply of Director services, please also refer to
          Public Clarification VATP009 on this matter, available on the FTA&apos;s website.</p>
        <em>Deregistration</em>
        <p>
          If, because of the coming into effect of Article 3(2) of the Executive Regulation, a natural person
          who is registered for VAT is not meeting the requirements for mandatory registration anymore, such
          natural person must deregister for VAT purposes, in accordance with Article 21 of the
          Decree-Law <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a>
          </sup> and Article 14 of the Executive Regulation <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a>
          </sup>, without prejudice to
          Article 18 of the Executive Regulation. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a>
          </sup></p>

        <p>
          It is important to note that, in case the natural person also has activities, other than performing
          the function of Director on a Board of Directors, that qualify as supplies
          of goods or services or any other activities under Article 19 of the Decree- Law <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a>
          </sup>, only the
          performance
          of functions as Director on a Board of Directors will be excluded from the calculation of the
          registration threshold from 01 January
          2023.</p>
        <p>
          For example, the Director may also rent out commercial properties and/or make other supplies through
          sole establishments. The value of these supplies must still be taken into account for VAT
          registration threshold purposes, as well as the value of any other activity as stated in Article 19
          of the Decree-Law.</p>

                    threshold and the Authority is satisfied that his supplies, according to the provisions of the
                    Decree-Law, or taxable expenses, expected over the next 30 days, are not expected to exceed the

                Where the Authority is satisfied that the conditions in Clause 2 above are met, and the
                registrant has not applied for deregistration, the Authority shall deregister the registrant with
                effect from the last day of the tax period in which the Authority became satisfied that the

                A registrant shall not be deregistered unless he has paid all tax and administrative penalties

                Procedures.</p>

                of business carried on by a registrant shall be deemed to be supplied by him at a time immediately
                before ceasing to be a registrant and any tax payable shall be included in the final tax return,
                unless the business is carried on by an appointed trustee in bankruptcy pursuant to the Federal Law
                No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures.</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Where a registrant requests to be deregistered from tax due to the reduction of his taxable
                supplies to less than the mandatory registration threshold, the Authority will, if in agreement with
                the Registrant, cancel
                the tax registration with effect from:</p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  <p>The

                <li>
                  <p>
                    The date on which the request is made if the Registrant did not indicate the preferred
                    deregistration
                    date.</p>
                </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Where the Authority has deregistered a registrant from tax, it shall notify that registrant of
                the date on which deregistration takes effect within 10 business days of making the
                decision.</p>

            Article 18 of the Executive Regulation states that deregistration does not
            exempt the person from his obligations and liabilities that were applicable under the Decree-Law
            while he was still a registrant.</p>

          <p><sup><a href="#bookmarkback7" id="bookmark7">[7]</a></sup>
