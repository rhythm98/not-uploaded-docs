                <h3>Issue</h3>
                <p>
                    The tax procedures in the UAE are regulated by Federal Decree-Law No. 28 of 2022 on Tax Procedures
                    ('Decree-Law') and its Executive Regulation. Cabinet Decision No. 74 of 2023 ('New Executive
                    Regulation') repealed Cabinet Decision No. 36 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of Federal Law No.
                    7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, and its amendments ('Previous Executive Regulation'),
                    with effect from 1 August 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the provisions of the Previous Executive
                    Regulation were incorporated in the New Executive Regulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Public Clarification is intended to inform persons of the changes made in the New Executive
                    Regulation where these differ from the provisions
                    of the Previous Executive Regulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Articles that remained materially the same (except for renumbering) are not covered by this Public
                    Clarification.

                </p>

                <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
                <p>The main changes in the New Executive Regulation are detailed below.</p>

                <h3>Definitions (Article 1)<a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
                <p>The number of definitions has been limited under Article 1 of the New Executive Regulation as the
                    definitions under Article 1 of the Decree-Law also apply for the New Executive Regulation. When
                    reviewing their legal obligations and rights, all persons must ensure they refer to the definitions
                    in the Decree-Law in conjunction with the provisions of the New Executive Regulation.</p>

                <p>The definition of the term 'assets' has been expanded to include intangible assets. This means that
                    the definition includes, for example, patents, brands, licenses, trademarks, computer programs,
                    copyrights, goodwill and also customer lists. The definition of assets has a particular importance
                    for the application of Article 18 of the New Executive Regulation.</p>

                <h3>Accounting records and commercial books (Article 2)<a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'><sup>2</sup></a>
                </h3>
                <p>In addition to the records and books of the business, businesses must also retain all documents that
                    support entries in the accounting records and commercial books of the business.</p>

                <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant correspondence, invoices and tax invoices, licenses and agreements/contracts related to
                        the business.</li>
                    <li>Documents containing details of any election, determination or calculation made by a taxable
                        person in relation to its tax affairs, including the basis, method of estimation, determination
                        made and calculation performed.</li>
                    <li>Documents with respect to related party transactions and with respect to the circumstances under
                        which such transactions were made, including, for example, transfer pricing documents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Period of record keeping (Article 3)<a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'><sup>3,4,5</sup></a></h3>
                <p>All accounting records, commercials books and all documents and information referred to under Article
                    2 of the New Executive Regulation are to be held in a way to enable the FTA to conduct its tax
                    audits and verify a person's compliance with its tax obligations. They must also be maintained for
                    defined periods depending on whether a person is a taxable person or not or depending on the nature
                    of the record or document.</p>

                <p>The New Executive Regulation specifies that, for real estate records, the retention period is seven
                    years from the end of the calendar year in which such record or document was created.</p>

                <p>For example, if a property was sold on 2 January 2025, the end of the calendar year in which the
                    record is created would be 31 December 2025. Consequently, the related records and accounts must be
                    retained until 31 December 2032.</p>

                <p>The general document retention period of five years will be extended by one year starting from the
                    date of submission of a voluntary disclosure in the fifth year from the end of the relevant tax
                    period.</p>

                <p>This means, for example, that a taxable person who discovers an error requiring a voluntary
                    disclosure related to a tax period ending on 31 December 2019, and submits the voluntary disclosure
                    application on 14 June 2024 (i.e. in the fifth year from the end of the relevant tax period), the
                    person is required to retain the related records until 14 June 2025 although the retention period
                    previously would have ended on 31 December 2024, except for real estate records and related
                    documents.</p>

                <p>Legal representatives, as defined under Article 1 of the Decree-Law, are required to retain the
                    required books and records of the person they are representing for a period of one year from the
                    date on which such legal representation ends.</p>

                <p>The retention periods under Article 3(1) and (2) of the New Executive Regulation remain applicable
                    when a person has been appointed a legal representative and will continue to apply in the event that
                    legal representation ends for that person. The period of one year is an onus on the legal
                    representative.</p>

                <h3>Language (Article 5)<a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'><sup>6</sup></a></h3>
                <p>Under the Previous Executive Regulation, the tax return, data, information, records and any other
                    documents related to tax, had to be submitted, by default, to the FTA in Arabic.</p>

                <p>Under the New Executive Regulation, the FTA may now accept the tax return, data, information, records
                    and any other documents related to tax to be submitted in English or Arabic.</p>

                <p>If the documents were submitted in English, the FTA may, at its discretion, request to translate some
                    or all documents into Arabic within a period that the FTA will specify in its request. The
                    translation into Arabic must be approved in accordance with the law regulating translations in the
                    UAE, which implies the requirement of using a translator who is on the translators list as defined
                    under the Federal Law No. 6 of 2012.</p>

                <h3>Procedures relating to Tax Registration, Deregistration, and Amending Details of Registration
                    (Article 6)<a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'><sup>7,8</sup></a></h3>
                <p>Under the New Executive Regulation, the list of instances is expanded in which registrants are
                    required to notify the FTA of changes to their business data to include notification of the
                    following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>E-mail address.</li>
                    <li>Trade licence activities.</li>
                    <li>Legal status and partnership agreement for unincorporated partnerships.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The FTA may, according to the New Executive Regulation, at its discretion but in accordance with the
                    relevant Tax law, deregister a registrant where the person is required to deregister for a specific
                    tax type but fails to submit a deregistration application.</p>

                <p>This would, for example, include the following instances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A person continuously submits nil returns for Excise Tax, or where the value of supplies/taxable
                        expenses do not meet the voluntary registration threshold for the purposes of VAT registration.
                    </li>
                    <li>A person registered for Excise Tax ceases to manufacture or import excise goods.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>UAE Licensing bodies (Article 7)<a href='#bookmark9' id='bookmarkback9'><sup>9</sup></a></h3>
                <p>Under the Previous Executive Regulation, with respect to trade licences, and now under Article 7 of
                    the New Executive Regulation, licensing bodies in the UAE must now also notify the FTA, within 20
                    business days of any issuance or renewal, of a number of data regarding the license.</p>

                <p>This obligation for licensing bodies does not exonerate the concerned registrant from his obligations
                    under Article 6(4) of the New Executive Regulation.</p>

                <h3>Voluntary disclosure (Article 10)<a href='#bookmark10' id='bookmarkback10'><sup>10</sup></a></h3>
                <p>If a taxpayer becomes aware of an error or omission in a tax return submitted to the FTA that did not
                    impact on the due tax for that tax period, the person is required to submit a voluntary disclosure
                    to rectify the error.</p>

                <p>Errors with no impact on due tax include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Failing to report imported services, where the business is entitled to full input tax recovery
                        in respect of the supply.</li>
                    <li>Reporting supplies in Box 1 of the VAT return against an Emirate other than the Emirate in which
                        supplies should have been recorded.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Means of notification (Article 11)<a href='#bookmark11' id='bookmarkback11'><sup>11</sup></a></h3>
                <p>The means of notification by the FTA towards a person now also includes text messages on mobile
                    phones, notifications through smart applications, and notifications through the FTA's electronic
                    systems. With respect to smart application, it should be noted that the FTA's mobile application can
                    be downloaded by both iOS and Android users since 17 April 2023 and 15 May 2023, respectively.</p>

                <p>As under the Previous Executive Regulation, postings of notifications in the premises of the person
                    must be made on a prominent place such as the reception area. Any other means to be used for the
                    notification than the means listed under Article 11 of the Executive Regulation, must be agreed in
                    writing by the person and the FTA. A verbal agreement will not be in line with the New Executive
                    Regulation.</p>

                <h3>Tax Agents – Natural persons (Article 12)<a href='#bookmark12' id='bookmarkback12'><sup>12,13,14</sup></a>
                </h3>
                <p>With the introduction of Corporate Tax in the UAE, the system of tax agents in the UAE is being
                    updated. The updates are around specialism, experience required, education, registering as natural
                    vs. juridical persons, language, procedures for tax agent listing and renewal and professional
                    behaviour and integrity.</p>

                <p>The New Executive Regulation provides the legal framework for the system of tax agents and this
                    framework will be further regulated through Decisions that will, amongst others, clarify
                    requirements around continuous professional development, the national and international bodies that
                    the FTA will recognise who can provide valid professional certification for the purposes of
                    registering tax agents, and the number of natural person tax agents required for a juridical tax
                    agent to be listed.</p>

                <p>A natural person wishing to register as a tax agent must have at least the following education and
                    relevant tax, accounting or legal experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Three years relevant experience obtained in the preceding five years, plus a Bachelor or Masters
                        degree in tax, accounting, or law from an educational institution recognized by the UAE
                        competent authorities. The certification of the degree must be done in line with the UAE
                        applicable legislation;</li>
                    <li>Three years relevant experience obtained in the preceding five years plus a Bachelor or Masters
                        degree in any other field (other than tax, accounting, or law) from an educational institution
                        recognized by the UAE competent authorities, and a valid professional qualification from an
                        approved institution as specified by the FTA for purposes of presenting such qualification. The
                        certification of the degree must be done in line with the UAE applicable legislation; or</li>
                    <li>Five years relevant experience obtained in the preceding eight years plus a Bachelor or Masters
                        degree in any field from an educational institution recognized by the UAE competent authorities.
                        The certification of the degree must be done in line with the UAE applicable legislation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The natural person tax agent shall need to pass a qualification test, as will be specified by the
                    FTA, whereby distinct tests will be in place for indirect tax and Corporate Tax. The tax agent shall
                    also complete the necessary training, which will be on an ongoing basis, as specified by the FTA.
                </p>

                <p>It is no longer a requirement for the tax agent to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>be able to communicate in both Arabic and English as fluency in either of these languages is
                        acceptable.</li>
                    <li>submit proof that the person is medically fit to perform the duties of the profession.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Members of the Tax Dispute Resolution Committee are not allowed to be registered as tax agents.</p>

                <h3>Tax agents – Juridical persons (Article 12)<a href='#bookmark15' id='bookmarkback15'><sup>15</sup></a></h3>
                <p>The concept of a juridical person tax agent has been added in the UAE tax legislation. To be
                    registered as tax agent, a juridical person tax agent must meet the following requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold a trade license reflecting that the legal person is licensed as an audit, tax or law firm.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hold or be covered under a valid professional indemnity insurance that is appropriate to the
                        nature and size of the business.</li>
                    <li>Have at least one partner or director who meets all of the requirements to be eligible to
                        register and registers with the FTA as a natural person tax agent who supervises the services
                        provided by the juridical person, and does not work for another juridical person or for its
                        benefit.</li>
                    <li>Meet any additional conditions prescribed by the FTA.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It must be noted that tax agents will be listed separately as Corporate Tax and Indirect tax (VAT and
                    Excise Tax) agents. Separate training and qualifying examinations will be specified or prescribed.
                </p>

                <p>A tax agent can be listed for both Corporate Tax and Indirect tax but can only represent a person for

                        id='bookmarkback16'><sup>16-21</sup></a></h3>
                <p>The New Executive Regulation stated detailed procedures for listing and delisting tax agents,
                    including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a person fails to pay the relevant fees to be listed as a tax agent within 20 business days
                        from the date of being notified of meeting the tax agent eligibility criteria, the application
                        to be listed as a tax agent is considered to be cancelled. In such instance, a new application
                        may be submitted if the person wishes to be listed as a tax agent.</li>
                    <li>Every natural person tax agent is required to renew his/her tax agent registration every three
                        years whereas juridical tax agents are required to renew their registration every year.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Renewal applications have to be submitted at least twenty business days before the expiration of the
                    tax agent's listing, and the relevant renewal fee has to be paid to the FTA within the prescribed
                    period.</p>

                <p>Any renewal request submitted later than 20 business days before the date the listing expires, is
                    treated as a new application and not a renewal request.</p>

                <p>If a tax agent fails to apply for a renewal before the expiry of the listing, the person will be
                    removed from the tax agent list and the person will no longer be allowed to practice as a tax agent.
                </p>

                <p>In such instance, the person may submit a new application (including all the required documents) to
                    be listed as a tax agent.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the person will be delinked from all taxpayers for which the person acted as tax agent.
                </p>

                <p>The FTA is obliged to de-list a tax agent if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It was proven to the FTA that the tax agent is unable to fulfil its duties or functions, or no
                        longer meets the conditions to be eligible to be listed as a tax agent.</li>
                    <li>The FTA has serious grounds to believe that the continued listing of the person as a tax agent
                        would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system in the UAE.</li>
                    <li>The tax agent committed a serious violation of the provisions of the Decree-Law or the tax law,
                        or committed, participated in or facilitated tax evasion.</li>
                    <li>The FTA becomes aware that the tax agent is a current member of the Tax Dispute Resolution
                        Committee.</li>
                </ul>

                        id='bookmarkback24'><sup>24-28</sup></a></h3>
                <p>
                    For tax evasion crimes and the deliberate failure to settle administrative penalties, a person may
                    submit a reconciliation application to the FTA before the initiation of the criminal case, provided
                    that the person undertakes to settle the full amounts of payable tax and administrative penalties to
                    the FTA as consideration for the reconciliation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, before a criminal case is initiated, for the specific tax crimes that are specified under
                    Article 25(4) of the Decree-Law, and where these crimes resulted in tax evasion or facilitated or
                    concealed tax evasion, the person must first make a payment of AED 50,000 before the FTA may
                    reconcile. Reconciliation shall be made by settling the full amounts of payable tax and
                    administrative penalties to the FTA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the FTA accepts the reconciliation application, a record shall be issued containing proof of the
                    reconciliation and its consideration. This document has to be signed by both parties, i.e. the FTA
                    and the person who submitted the reconciliation application. The FTA will provide a copy of such
                    record to the person after payment of the full consideration for the reconciliation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The accused or convicted person may submit a reconciliation application to the competent federal
                    public prosecution at any stage of the criminal case. The public prosecution shall seek the FTA's
                    opinion before proceeding with reconciliation procedures in tax crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the stage of the criminal case, also including the stage after issuance of a conviction
                    judgement, and on the nature of the tax crime, reconciliation can be made subject to settling the
                    full amount of payable tax and administrative penalties plus an additional amount calculated as a
                    percentage of the tax evaded and, in some cases, plus an additional fixed amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the public prosecution accepts the reconciliation application, it shall issue a record of
                    reconciliation after the full settlement of the full tax and administrative penalties payable and
                    additional consideration for the reconciliation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The record must be signed by both the competent public prosecution member and the accused or
                    convicted person, approved by the federal attorney general, and include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The details of the accused or convicted person.</li>

                        place of their occurrence and the articles of law applicable thereto.</li>
                    <li>The value of the tax and administrative penalties payable.</li>
                    <li>The percentage and value of the additional amount of consideration for the reconciliation.</li>
