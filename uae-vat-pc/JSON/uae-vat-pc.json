It should be noted that the purpose of the discussion is not to provide answers for all types of payments that might be made in such situations, but to give an example of principles that should be used in determining whether VAT should be due on compensation-type payments.</p></section><section><h3>A contractual payment to compensate for loss</h3><p>An example of such a compensatory payment are 'liquidated damages'. Liquidated damages are predetermined amounts that parties to an agreement designate during the formation of the agreement for the injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach – for example, for an early termination of a contract or a late performance.

Businesses are required by the VAT Decree-Law to use this exchange rate on any tax invoice issued in a currency other than the UAE Dirham from this date onwards.</p><p>Any tax invoices issued in a foreign currency prior to 17 May 2018 should have been converted to UAE Dirham using a reliable source for exchange rates. Provided this is the case, and the same source has been used consistently, there will be no need to rework tax invoices issued prior to 17 May 2018 where they do not use the UAE Central Bank exchange rate.</p></section><section><h3>Detailed Discussion</h3><h4>Tax invoices issued prior to 17 May 2018</h4><p>Where a tax invoice was issued prior to 17 May 2018 in a currency other than UAE Dirham, the tax invoice should have been converted to UAE Dirham using an exchange rate from a reliable source.</p><p>The source used to obtain the exchange rate should have been consistently used by the business for all tax invoices issued in foreign currencies during the period from 1 January to 16 May 2018.</p><h4>Examples of reliable exchange rate sources include, but are not limited to:</h4><ul><li>Thomson Reuters</li><li>Oanda</li><li>The exchange rate published by a UAE bank</li></ul></section><section><h3>Use of Historical Rates Published by the Central Bank</h3><p>The UAE Central Bank has also published on 17 May 2018, historical rates on its website, for periods prior to that date. There is no requirement for businesses to reissue historical tax invoices from periods prior to 17 May 2018 to show the Central Bank exchange rate, provided the exchange rate used is from a reliable source and the same source has been used consistently.</p><p>In the event a tax invoice is issued post 17 May 2018 but where the date of supply was prior to 17 May 2018, businesses should use the historical rates as published by the Central Bank.</p></section><section><h3>Use of Exchange Rates from 17 May 2018 Onwards</h3><p>Where a tax invoice is issued from 17 May 2018 onwards, it is required that the exchange rate published by the UAE Central Bank is used to convert the foreign currency to the UAE Dirham.</p><p>Businesses must use the exact exchange rate as published by the UAE Central Bank, which includes using the same number of decimal places as published.</p><p>For example, if the exchange rate for US Dollars is published as 3.672500, the full exchange rate should be used for the purposes of the tax invoice, and it is not permitted to round the exchange rate to fewer decimal places e.g. 3.7.</p></section><section><h3>Time of Publication of Exchange Rates</h3><p>The UAE Central Bank updates the exchange rates on its website each day on or after 6pm, to cover the rate applicable for that day. Where a tax invoice is issued prior to 6pm on any given day, it will be acceptable to use the exchange rate published on the UAE Central Bank website at the time the tax invoice is raised, i.e. the rate for the day before.</p></section><section><h3>Use of Exchange Rates for Imports of Services</h3><p>Where businesses import services from foreign suppliers which are subject to VAT under the reverse charge mechanism, the invoice received for the supply is likely to be in a foreign currency. For the purposes of applying the reverse charge mechanism to such imports, businesses should use the UAE Central Bank exchange rate applicable on the date of supply in order to calculate the VAT liability to be reported in the VAT return.</p><p>A foreign supplier, not VAT registered in the UAE, is likely to issue an invoice which is not a tax invoice for UAE VAT purposes. It is acceptable to use the date of the invoice as the date of supply of the imported service and use the exchange rate applying as per that date.</p></section><section><h3>Use of Exchange Rates for Imports of Goods</h3><p>Where goods are imported into the UAE, the VAT due on import shall be automatically calculated based on the import declarations submitted via the relevant Customs Department. This value is automatically populated in Box 6 of the VAT return.</p><p>Where invoices for imported goods are received in a foreign currency, the Customs department shall convert the value to UAE Dirham for the purposes of the import declaration. Where the Customs exchange rate used differs from the UAE Central Bank exchange rate, businesses shall be permitted to use the exchange rate applied by the Customs department for the purposes of declaring the VAT due on import.</p><p>There shall not be a requirement for businesses to convert the value of the import based on the UAE Central Bank rate and declare any adjustment due to exchange rate used within Box 7 of the VAT return.</p></section><section><h3>Public Clarification</h3><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify certain aspects related to the implementation of the Federal Law No 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax and their Executive Regulations.</p><p>This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of the aforementioned legislation.

If a benefit is received, VAT implications apply. If not, the payments are outside the scope of VAT and not considered consideration for a supply.</p></li><li><p>The use of the terms &quot;donation&quot;, &quot;sponsorship&quot;, and &quot;grant&quot; alone does not determine the VAT treatment. Businesses must evaluate all relevant facts and circumstances.</p></li></ul></section><section><h4>Detailed Discussion</h4><ul><li><p>VAT implications arise only where there is an underlying taxable supply. Despite the wide definition of &quot;consideration&quot;, VAT applies only if the payment relates to a taxable supply. It must be assessed whether the donor, grantor, or sponsor receives any benefit in the form of a supply. The benefit must be closely linked to the payment for VAT to apply.</p></li></ul></section><section><h4>Donations</h4><ul><li><p>If a donation is given without any express or implied benefit, it is not a consideration for a supply and is outside the scope of VAT. The donation must be unconditional and unrestricted. The following principles help determine this:</p><ul><li><p>Does the donor receive any benefit in return for the donation?</p></li><li><p>Does any person other than the donor receive any benefit in return for the donation?</p></li><li><p>Is there any condition stating that the donation must be used in a specific way that benefits the donor or another person?</p></li><li><p>Is there any written or oral agreement between the parties? If yes, what does the agreement stipulate?</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section><h4>Clarification on Donations, Sponsorships, and Grants</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Example – Donations:</strong> If a business donates money to a hospital and in return the hospital provides space for marketing or product display, the donation is treated as consideration for a taxable supply and attracts VAT.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sponsorships:</strong> Sponsorships are generally subject to VAT, as the recipient often provides something in return to the sponsor. This may include:</p><ul><li><p>Displaying the sponsor’s logo</p></li><li><p>Allowing use of the recipient’s name</p></li><li><p>Providing entertainment services</p></li><li><p>Hosting the sponsor at restaurants</p></li><li><p>Providing tickets or access to events</p></li></ul><p>All facts and circumstances must be considered holistically to determine the VAT treatment.</p><p><strong>Example – Sponsorship:</strong> A business agrees to sponsor AED 100,000 for a football match in exchange for logo placement at the stadium entrance. This sponsorship is subject to VAT as there is a benefit provided in return.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grants:</strong> Similar to donations and sponsorships, VAT treatment of grants depends on whether any benefit is received by the grantor in return.</p><p>If no benefit is received, the grant is outside the scope of VAT. However, if the grantor does receive a benefit, the grant is subject to VAT.</p><p><strong>Example – Grant:</strong> A person gives a grant to a university to conduct research, and the results of the research will be used in the grantor’s business. This grant is subject to VAT as it provides a direct benefit to the grantor.</p></li></ul></section><section><h4>Donations, Sponsorships, and Grants in the Form of Goods</h4><ul><li><p>There may be cases where donations, sponsorships, and grants are given in the form of goods. In such cases, deemed supply provisions may apply under the UAE VAT Law.</p></li></ul></section><section><h4>Legal Disclaimer and Scope of Clarification</h4><ul><li><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA aims to clarify certain aspects related to the implementation of the Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and their respective Executive Regulations.</p></li><li><p>This Clarification outlines the FTA’s position and does not amend or intend to amend any provision of the above legislation. Therefore, it is effective from the date of implementation of the relevant legislation, unless stated otherwise.</p></li></ul></section></main></div></body></html>",

It also outlines the recourse available to taxable persons in cases where input tax is not recovered within the prescribed time-period.</p></section><section><h4>Summary</h4><p>Input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following two conditions are satisfied:</p><ul><li>The tax invoice is received; and</li><li>An intention is formed to make the payment of consideration for the supply before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment.</li></ul><p>Upon receipt of a tax invoice, a taxable person can recover input tax only when an intention to make the payment within a prescribed period is formed. If the intention to pay is formed in a tax period later than the one in which the tax invoice is received, the input tax may only be recovered in that later period.</p></section><section><h4>Detailed Discussion</h4><p>Article 55(1) of the VAT Law prescribes that input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following conditions are satisfied:</p><ul><li>The taxable person receives the tax invoice; and</li><li>The taxable person pays the consideration for the supply or any part thereof.</li></ul><p>Article 54(2) of Cabinet Decision No. (52) of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&amp;quot;VAT Executive Regulations&amp;quot;) refers to Article 55(1) of the VAT Law. It provides that a taxable person is treated as having made a payment of consideration to the extent that they intend to make the payment before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment for the supply.</p></section><section><h4>Detailed Clarification</h4><p>A concurrent reading of Article 55(1) of the VAT Law and Article 54 of the VAT Executive Regulations provides that input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following two conditions are satisfied:</p><ul><li>The tax invoice is received; and</li><li>There is an intention to make the payment of consideration of the supply before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment.</li></ul><p>A taxable person may receive a tax invoice but may not have an intention to make the payment until the internal approval process is completed. In such cases, the conditions of Article 55(1) are not satisfied because the intention to pay within the six-month period has not been formed.</p><p>The FTA considers that the conditions under Article 55(1) will be met only when the internal approval process is completed and an intention to make the payment within the prescribed period is formed.</p><p>Therefore, before recovering input tax, the taxable person must substantiate that in addition to receiving the tax invoice, the intention to make the payment within the prescribed period has also been formed.</p><p>To avoid doubt: if a tax invoice is received in one tax period but the intention to pay is formed in a later period, the input tax can only be recovered in that later tax period.</p><p>If the input tax is not recovered in the tax period where both conditions are met, the taxable person can recover the input tax in the immediate next tax period.</p><p>If input tax is not recovered in the first two eligible tax periods, the taxable person is required to submit a voluntary disclosure. This disclosure should amend the input tax reported in the VAT return for one of those two periods.</p></section><section><h4>Non-Payment Before Six-Month Expiry</h4><p>Where a taxable person fails to make the payment of consideration before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment, the taxable person must reduce the input tax in the VAT return of the period following the expiry of the six-month period.</p><p>However, once the payment is eventually made, the taxable person becomes entitled to recover the input tax again.</p></section><section><h4>Non-Payment Before Six-Month Expiry</h4><p>Where a taxable person fails to make the payment of consideration before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment, the taxable person should reduce the input tax in the VAT Return of the tax period following the expiry of the six-month period.</p><p>However, once the payment is made, the taxable person will again be entitled to recover the input tax.</p></section><section><h4>Legal Status of Public Clarification</h4><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is intended to clarify certain aspects related to the implementation of the Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and their Executive Regulations.</p><p>This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of the aforementioned legislation.

After the permitted use is changed, the purchaser must account for 5% VAT on the supply of the building to a third party if the purchaser is a Taxable Person.</p></section><section><h3>Detailed Discussion</h3><h4>Legislative Background</h4><p>In this clarification, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as \u201cDecree-Law\u201d and Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as \u201cExecutive Regulations\u201d.</p><p>According to Article 2, read with Article 3 of the Decree-Law, 5% VAT shall be imposed on every taxable supply made in the UAE by a Taxable Person unless the supply qualifies for zero-rating or exemption under the provisions of Title Six of the Decree-Law. The term \u2018Taxable Person\u2019 is defined in Article 1 of the Decree-Law as any person who is, or is required to be, registered for VAT in the UAE.</p><p>Article 45(9) of the Decree-Law allows the first supply of a residential building within three years of completion to be zero-rated irrespective of whether the building is sold or leased, and whether in part or as a whole.</p><p>Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law exempts the supply of residential buildings through sale or lease unless the supply qualifies for zero-rating under Article 45(9) and 45(11). Article 43(1) of the Executive Regulations states that the supply of residential buildings is exempt\u2014unless zero-rated\u2014where the lease is more than six months or the tenant of the property is a holder of an ID card issued by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship.</p><p>Article 37(1) of the Executive Regulations defines the term \u2018residential building\u2019 to include any building or part of a building that the person occupies, or that it can be foreseen that a person will occupy, as their principal place of residence.</p><p>Article 37(2) of the Executive Regulations explicitly excludes the following from the definition of \u2018residential building\u2019:</p><ul><li>Any building that is used as a hotel, motel, bed and breakfast establishment, or hospital of the like.</li><li>A hotel apartment for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided.</li></ul><p>Since the sale of a building is an indivisible supply of a good, the general date of supply rule, as set out in Article 25 of the Decree-Law will apply. That is, the date of supply is the earlier of the date:</p><ul><li>Ownership of the building is transferred to the purchaser (as evidenced by the registration at the relevant government entity);</li><li>On which the purchaser took possession of the building;</li><li>Payment was received in respect of the supply of the building; or</li><li>A Tax Invoice was issued in respect of the supply of the building.</li></ul><p>In the case of a lease with either periodic payments or consecutive invoices, the special date of supply rules set out in Article 26 of the Decree-Law will apply. That is, the date of supply would be the earlier of the date:</p><ul><li>Any Tax Invoice is issued in respect of the lease of the building;</li><li>Payment is received in respect of the lease.</li></ul></section><section><h4>Special Date of Supply Rules (Lease)</h4><p>In case of a lease with periodic payments or consecutive invoices, Article 26 of the Decree-Law applies. The date of supply is the earlier of:</p><ul><li>Any Tax Invoice is issued in respect of the lease of the building;</li><li>Any payment is due as shown on the Tax Invoice;</li><li>Payment is received in respect of the lease of the building; or</li><li>12 months lapse from the date the right to use the building was provided to the lessee.</li></ul></section><section><h4>Accounting for VAT on Instalments</h4><p>Article 19 of the Executive Regulations states that where VAT becomes due due to a payment or tax invoice, it is only due to the extent of the payment or the amount stated on the tax invoice. VAT can be accounted for as the amounts are billed or paid.</p></section><section><h3>Sale of a Building</h3><p>In the context of this clarification, the supply of an apartment or any unit within a building is treated as the supply of a \u201cbuilding\u201d.</p><p>The sale of a building is a single indivisible supply on the date of supply as per Article 25 of the Decree-Law. If the sale agreement allows for multiple instalments, VAT is due only to the extent of the actual amount paid or billed, as per Article 19 of the Executive Regulations.</p><p>As the VAT treatment of the sale crystalizes on the date of supply:</p><ul><li>Any change in use before the date of supply is disregarded \u2014 only the permitted use at the date of supply is considered.</li><li>Any subsequent change in permitted use will not impact the VAT treatment of the original sale.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Purchaser \u2013 Acquisition and Subsequent Supply of a Residential Building</h3><p>If the seller sold a residential building to a purchaser who then leases or sells it to a third party, two separate supplies occur:</p><ul><li><strong>First supply:</strong> The seller supplies the residential building to the buyer on the date of supply. If this is the first supply within 3 years of completion, the supply may be zero-rated. Otherwise, it may be exempt under Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law.</li><li><strong>Second supply:</strong> The purchaser leases or sells the building as a principal place of residence to a third party. This supply is exempt under Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law.</li><li>The purchaser may amend the use of the building to lease or sell it as a serviced or hotel apartment to a third party. This supply is subject to 5% VAT if the purchaser (the owner) is a Taxable Person (i.e., registered or required to register for VAT).</li></ul></section><section><h3>Purchaser \u2013 Acquisition of a Non-Residential Building and Subsequent Supply</h3><p>A non-residential building refers to any building not falling within the definition of a \u2018residential building\u2019, such as hotel or serviced apartments.</p><p>If the seller sold a non-residential building to a purchaser who subsequently leases or sells it to a third party, two separate supplies occur:</p><ul><li><strong>First supply:</strong> The seller supplies the building to the buyer on the date of supply as determined under the general rules. This supply is subject to 5% VAT if the seller is a Taxable Person.</li><li><strong>Second supply:</strong> The purchaser amends the permitted use and leases or sells the building to a third party as a principal residence (i.e., as a \u2018residential building\u2019). This supply is exempt under Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law; or</li><li>The purchaser leases or sells the building as a serviced/hotel apartment to a third party. This supply is subject to 5% VAT if the purchaser (the owner of the building) is a Taxable Person.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The VAT treatment of the sale of a building is independent from the purchaser's subsequent supply. Therefore, it remains the same regardless of whether the purchaser later amends the permitted use to lease or sell the building as a residential unit or hotel/serviced apartment.</p></section><section><h4>Clarification by the FTA</h4><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA aims to explain certain aspects of the implementation of Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and their Executive Regulations.</p><p>It states the FTA\u2019s position and does not amend or intend to amend any legislative provisions.

This zero-rating rule is further supplemented by additional rules and conditions in Article 31(2) and (3) of the Executive Regulation.</p></section><section><h3>Summary</h3><p>In accordance with Article 31(1)(a)(1) of the Executive Regulation, a supply may only be zero-rated where the recipient of services does not have a place of residence in an Implementing State and is outside the UAE at the time the services are performed.</p></section><section><h3>Detailed Discussion</h3><p>Article 31(1)(a) of the Executive Regulation allows the zero-rating of the export of services, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include the following in subsection (1):</p><ul><li><p>The Services are supplied to a Recipient of Services who does not have a Place of Residence in an Implementing State and who is outside the State at the time the Services are performed.</p></li></ul><p>Subsection (1) of Article 31(1)(a) contains two requirements for zero-rating:</p><ul><li><p>The recipient should not have a place of residence in an Implementing State.</p></li><li><p>The recipient should be outside the UAE at the time the services are performed by the supplier.</p></li></ul><p>Article 1 of the Decree-Law defines &amp;quot;Implementing States&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;GCC States that are implementing a Tax law pursuant to an issued legislation&amp;quot;. Article 70(15) of the Executive Regulation states that a GCC State shall be treated as an Implementing State if it reciprocates the treatment and complies with the Common VAT Agreement of the GCC.</p><p>It should be noted that currently, the UAE does not recognise any other state as an &amp;quot;Implementing State&amp;quot; for VAT purposes. Consequently, the first condition will be satisfied if the recipient does not have a place of residence in the UAE.</p><p>A recipient may have a place of residence in the UAE if it has either of the following:</p><ul><li><p>A place of establishment \u2013 where significant management decisions are made or central management functions are conducted.</p></li><li><p>A fixed establishment \u2013 any fixed place of business with sufficient human and technology resources to supply/acquire goods or services, including branches.</p></li></ul><p>If the recipient has multiple establishments in different countries, it is necessary to determine which one is most closely related to the supply. The place of residence shall be the country where this establishment is located (Article 32 of the Decree Law).</p><p>For example, if the recipient has a head office (place of establishment) outside the UAE and a branch (fixed establishment) in the UAE, and the services relate only to the head office\u2019s activities, the head office will be considered most closely related to the supply, and thus the place of residence would be outside the UAE.</p><p>In contrast, if a UAE supplier provides services to a UAE branch of a foreign head office and the services are solely for the branch\u2019s purposes, then the branch is considered most closely related to the supply and the place of residence is the UAE. As a result, the supply would not qualify for zero-rating.</p><p>In cases where both establishments benefit from the supply, the supplier must objectively assess the following factors to determine which establishment is most closely related to the supply:</p><ul><li><p>Which establishment is the contractual recipient of the supply;</p></li><li><p>Which establishment actually benefits from the supply;</p></li><li><p>Which establishment will receive the invoice and make payment;</p></li><li><p>Which establishment provides instructions to the supplier;</p></li></ul></section><section><h3>Additional Considerations for Establishment</h3><ul><li><p>Whether the services are related to business being carried on by the recipient through an establishment in a particular country.</p></li></ul></section><section><h3>Special Note on Natural Persons</h3><p>It should be noted that where a person does not have a place of establishment or a fixed establishment in any country (for example, a natural person), then the place of residence of the person is the state in which the usual place of residence is located (Article 32(3) of the Decree-Law).</p></section><section><h3>Condition 2: Location of the Recipient</h3><p>The second condition for zero-rating is that the services are supplied to the recipient who is outside the UAE at the time the services are performed.</p><p>In other words, in order to determine whether this condition is satisfied, it is necessary to consider whether the recipient has any physical presence in the UAE at the time the services are performed. The requirement that the location of the recipient should be determined &amp;quot;at the time when the services are performed&amp;quot; requires consideration of the nature of the services supplied, and the period or duration during which the services are performed by the supplier and consumed by the recipient.</p><p>Only the physical presence of the recipient during the period or periods in which the supplier performs services and the recipient consumes them needs to be taken into account. The location of the recipient before or after the services are performed and consumed should not be taken into account for the purposes of this condition.</p><p>For example, where services are such that they are continuously performed and consumed over a duration of time, then any presence of the recipient during commencement, throughout, or completion of the service in the UAE would result in the recipient being treated as being within the UAE &amp;quot;at the time the services are performed&amp;quot;.</p><p>Similarly, if the services are of a nature that they are performed and consumed at the time of completion, then the location of the recipient at the time of completion of the services will determine whether the recipient is outside or inside the UAE at the time the services are performed.</p></section><section><h3>Multiple Establishments</h3><p>It should be noted that where the recipient has multiple establishments, the supplier should only take into account the establishment of the recipient which is most closely related to the supply being made in determining whether the recipient is outside or inside the UAE at the time the services are performed.</p><p>Therefore, where the recipient has establishments both inside and outside the UAE and the supply is most closely connected with the non-resident establishment of the recipient, then that non-resident establishment of the recipient will be treated as the location of the recipient for the purposes of Article 31(1)(a) of the Executive Regulation.</p><p>In such circumstances, the condition that the recipient is outside the UAE will be considered satisfied.</p></section><section><h3>Zero-Rating Despite UAE Establishment</h3><p>The condition that the recipient is outside the UAE would be met even if the recipient also has a UAE establishment.</p></section><section><h3>Temporary Presence Nullifying Zero-Rating</h3><p>It is important to note that a non-resident recipient of services (including a recipient which may already have a UAE establishment) may lose the ability to receive a zero-rated supply where they create a temporary presence in the UAE at the time the services are performed, which relates to the supply being made.</p><p>For example, where a non-resident recipient of legal services relating to some arbitration sends its representative to the UAE to be present during the hearing, the law firm making the supply would not be able to zero-rate the supply of the services relating to the arbitration process during which the client was present in the UAE \u2013 since the non-resident client, through its representative, was physically present in the UAE at the time the services were performed by the law firm.</p></section><section><h3>Natural Persons vs. Legal Entities</h3><p>The above principles relate to companies and other entities, which are capable of being established and present in multiple locations simultaneously, and do not apply to natural persons who are incapable of having a simultaneous presence in multiple locations. Therefore, where an individual is physically inside the UAE, he or she cannot be &amp;quot;outside the State&amp;quot;. This presence of the individual in the UAE at the time the services are performed would typically take away the ability of the supplier to zero-rate the supply to the individual.</p></section><section><h3>Extension to the Term &amp;quot;Outside the State&amp;quot;</h3><p>It should be noted that Article 31(2) of the Executive Regulation provides a special extension to the meaning of the term &amp;quot;outside the State&amp;quot;. This is discussed below.</p><p>Article 31(2) of the Executive Regulation provides an exception to the condition that the recipient of the services must be physically outside the UAE for zero-rating to apply. Specifically, a person can still be considered as being outside the UAE where they only have a short-term presence in the UAE of less than a month <u>and</u> the presence is not effectively connected with the supply.</p><p>The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the ability to zero-rate a supply is not unduly affected where the recipient has a UAE presence which is both short-term and is not effectively connected with the supply. As a consequence, this presence is unlikely to be known to the supplier of the zero-rated services.</p><p>For example, a recipient would still be considered to be outside the UAE in situations involving the following scenarios:</p><ul><li><p>A UK-resident company employs a UAE law firm to represent it during an ongoing litigation before the UAE courts. During the course of the litigation, one of the company\u2019s employees comes to the UAE for a conference not related to the ongoing litigation.</p></li><li><p>A UAE investment fund provides fund management services to a US-based company. The company has a UAE branch which is not related to the supply being made by the investment fund. The US establishment sends a staff member to the UAE for 3 weeks to provide training to the employees of the UAE branch.</p></li><li><p>A Canadian resident natural person engages a UAE company for assistance with due diligence on a company he is interested in investing in. During the process, the person comes to the UAE on a week-long holiday and does not visit the UAE company or meet with its employees.</p></li></ul></section><section><h3>Supplier\u2019s Responsibility</h3><p>Since zero-rating is an exception to the default VAT rate, a supply should only be zero-rated where the supplier can ascertain that all of the above conditions for the application of the 0% rate are satisfied.</p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure that the zero-rated treatment is not applied incorrectly, the supplier should consider all available facts and seek, if necessary, additional information from the recipient in order to identify the recipient\u2019s residency status and location at the time the services are performed.</p><p>If the supplier is not able to establish the necessary facts to ascertain if the zero-rating conditions are met, the supplier must standard-rate the supply.</p></section><section><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>This Public Clarification issued\n</p></section></main></div></body></html>",

This is on the basis that no other event which triggers the date of supply has taken\nplace prior to the date on which the invoice is issued.</p><p>If that invoice is not paid and a bad debt situation occurs, the VAT accounted for by the supplier is\nlikely to become a real cost to the business. The Bad Debt relief scheme seeks to provide relief to the\nsupplier in such instances by permitting an adjustment of the VAT charged but not paid by the\ncustomer.</p><h3>Conditions to Benefit from the Bad Debt Relief Scheme</h3><p>In order to benefit from the Bad Debt relief scheme, the following four conditions must be met:</p><ul><li><strong>The goods and services should have been supplied and VAT on the supply should have been charged and accounted for.</strong></li><li><strong>The consideration for the supply should have been written off in full or in part as a bad debt in the accounts of the supplier.</strong></li><li><strong>More than six months should have passed from the date of the supply.</strong></li><li><strong>The supplier should have notified the customer of the amount of consideration for the supply that has been written off.</strong></li></ul><h3>VAT Should Have Been Accounted for and Paid on the Supply</h3><p>The first condition requires that the VAT on the supply must have been charged and paid by the\nsupplier. The FTA considers that this condition will be satisfied where the supplier has charged VAT\non the tax invoice and has also accounted for VAT to the FTA via its tax returns.</p><h3>Consideration for the Supply Should Have Been Written Off</h3><p>The second condition mandates the supplier to have written off the whole or part of the consideration\nfor the supply as a bad debt in its accounts.</p><p>It is important to note that the bad debt relief can only be taken to the extent of the consideration\nwritten off in the accounts. Therefore, if only a part of consideration is written off, a bad debt relief\ncan be taken only to the extent of such written-off consideration.</p><p>For example, where a supplier issues an invoice for AED 105, where AED 100 represents the value of\nsupply and AED 5 represents the VAT amount. If the supplier is not able to collect the entire debt and\nwrites off AED 105, a bad debt adjustment of AED 5 can be taken.</p><p>On the other hand, if the supplier collects 50% of the consideration and consequently writes off\nAED 52.5, a bad debt adjustment of only AED 2.5 can be taken.</p></section><section><h3>More than Six Months Should Have Passed from the Date of Supply</h3><p>The third condition requires that the debt must have remained unpaid for a period of six months\nfrom the date of supply.</p><p>This means that a supplier must wait for six months from the date of supply to initiate the process of\nbad debt adjustment. The FTA considers that during the course of these six months, the supplier\nshould engage with the customer to recover the debt and collect the outstanding amount.</p></section><section><h3>Notification to the Customer Stating the Consideration for the Supply Which Has Been Written Off</h3><p>The fourth condition states that the supplier should have notified the customer of the amount\nof consideration that has been written off.</p><p>The FTA considers that the notification issued to the customer must, at the minimum, contain the\nfollowing information in addition to any other information that the supplier may choose to include:</p><ul><li>Invoice number and date of the tax invoice which has not been paid by the customer.</li><li>Amount of consideration that has been written off by the supplier.</li></ul><p>It may be noted that the Decree-Law does not prescribe any specific method through which a\nnotification should be made to the customer.</p></section><section><h3>Customer Notification Requirement</h3><p>FTA considers the requirement of notifying a customer will be satisfied where a supplier sends a\nletter, email, post, or any other similar communication to the customer stating the amount of\nconsideration that has been written off.</p><p>Please note that whilst it is not necessary for the supplier to receive an acknowledgement from the\ncustomer before taking the bad debt adjustment, a supplier needs to evidence documentation and/or\nthat best measures were taken to notify the customer. Evidence to this effect must be retained.</p></section><section><h3>Mechanism to Claim Bad Debt Relief</h3><p>Where a VAT registered supplier meets all the conditions prescribed in Article 64(1) of the\nDecree-Law, it is eligible to claim a bad debt relief.</p><p>Any adjustment on account of bad debt relief should be made in the \u201cAdjustment column\u201d of Box\n1 of the VAT Return.</p><p>The adjustment amount should be the VAT amount only and should be reported for each Emirate,\nwhere applicable, in accordance with the respective Output Tax amount being adjusted.</p></section><section><h3>Public Clarification</h3><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify certain aspects related to the implementation\nof the Federal Law No 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, Federal Decree-Law No 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax,\nand their Executive Regulations.</p><p>This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision\nof the aforementioned legislation. Therefore, it is effective as of the date of implementation of the relevant\nlegislation, unless stated otherwise.</p></section><section><h3>Legislative References</h3><h4>1. Article 64(1) of the Decree-Law</h4><p>Article 64(1) of the Decree-Law provides that a Registrant supplier may reduce the Output Tax in a\ncurrent Tax Period to adjust the Output Tax paid for any previous Tax Period if all of the following\nconditions are met:</p><ul><li>Goods and Services have been supplied, and the Due Tax has been charged and paid.</li><li>Consideration for the supply has been written off in full or part as a bad debt in the accounts of the supplier.</li><li>More than six (6) months has passed from the date of the supply.</li><li>The Registrant supplier has notified the Recipient of Goods and the Recipient of Services of the\namount of Consideration for the supply that has been written off.</li></ul><h4>2. Article 25 of the Decree-Law</h4><p>Article 25 of the Decree-Law provides that the date of supply is the earliest of the following dates:</p><ul><li>The date on which Goods were transferred, if such transfer was under the supervision of the supplier.</li><li>The date on which the Recipient of Goods took possession of the Goods, if the transfer was not supervised by the supplier.</li><li>Where goods are supplied with assembly and installation, the date on which the assembly or installation of the Goods was completed.</li><li>The date on which the Goods are Imported under the Customs Legislation.</li><li>The date on which the Recipient of Goods accepted the supply, or a date no later than (12) months after\nthe date on which the Goods were supplied.</li></ul></section></section></main></div></body></html>",

Therefore, the SWIFT message will be accepted as a sufficient record to establish the particulars of the supply, provided the following information is reflected on the SWIFT message:</p><ul><li>Name and address of the non-resident bank (SWIFT sender/supplier)</li><li>Name of the UAE financial institution receiving the service (SWIFT receiver/customer)</li><li>Date of the transaction</li><li>SWIFT message reference number</li><li>Transaction reference number</li><li>Description of the transaction</li><li>Consideration charged and currency used</li></ul><p>If the above requirements are met, the SWIFT message (\u201cQualifying SWIFT message\u201d) would be accepted as sufficient documentary evidence to prove the supply of the interbank service received from the non-resident bank, and the UAE financial institution shall be considered as having supplied the service to itself.</p><p>Considering the above, a UAE financial institution is not required to issue a tax invoice to itself if it retains the relevant Qualifying SWIFT message as evidence of the transaction.</p></section><section><h3>Input Tax Recovery</h3><p>Financial institutions are eligible to recover VAT incurred to the extent such costs are incurred to make taxable supplies.</p><p>The input tax may be recovered in the first tax return, or the immediately following tax period, in which the financial institution obtained the relevant supporting document and made payment or intends to make payment within 6 months of the agreed date for payment. For more information on the timeframe for recovering input tax, please refer to VATP017.</p><p>For purposes of input tax recovery, considering the nature of the Qualifying SWIFT message, it is accepted as sufficient documentary evidence to support the recovery of input tax that relates to this specific imported service. The recovery of input tax is subject to the other normal VAT recovery rules.</p></section><section><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify certain aspects related to the implementation of Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax and its Executive Regulation.</p><p>This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of the aforementioned legislation.

Further, there is no identifiable recipient to whom the mining activities are provided.</p></section><section><h3>Mining services supplied</h3><p>A person mining cryptocurrency on behalf of another person for a fee is considered to make a supply of services.7</p><p>As there is an identifiable recipient for the activity, and the person performing the mining on another person\u2019s behalf receives a consideration from his customer, the mining activities performed constitute a taxable supply of services.8</p><p>If the service is supplied by a taxable person to a customer in the UAE, the supply of services will be subject to the standard rate.</p><p>However, the supply may be zero-rated if it is made to a non-resident and all the requirements for zero rating under Article 31 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and its amendments, (&amp;quot;Executive Regulation&amp;quot;) are met.9</p></section><section><h3>Mining services received</h3><p>Where a UAE business receives mining services from a non-resident person such supply would be subject to VAT.</p><p>If the recipient of these services is registered for VAT in the UAE, they must account for the tax using the reverse charge mechanism on these concerned services.10</p><p>Conversely, if the customer is a UAE resident business and not a taxable person11, the non-resident supplier is required to register for VAT in the UAE12 and charge VAT on the services provided.</p></section><section><h3>Recovery of input tax</h3><p>A person mining crypto currency may incur input tax as part of his mining activities, including, for example, VAT incurred on purchases of hardware, rental of commercial real estate space, utility expenses and maintenance services.</p><p>Where the person is a registrant4, the person must consider his eligibility to recover the input tax incurred.</p><p>If a person is mining for his own account, the costs incurred would not be for the purpose of making taxable supplies.</p><p>Consequently, as the person mining for his own account is not making a taxable supply, the input tax incurred cannot be recovered.13</p><p>However, if the person acts as a service provider, and mines crypto currency on behalf of another person, the person may be eligible to recover the input tax to the extent the input tax is incurred for the purpose of making taxable supplies, provided that the relevant supporting evidence, e.g. tax\ninvoices, are retained.<sup>13</sup></p></section><section><p class=\"box\">This Public Clarification issued by the FTA is meant to clarify\ncertain aspects related to the implementation of the Federal\nDecree-Law.
