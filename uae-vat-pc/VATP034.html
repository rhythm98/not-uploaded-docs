                <h2>Issue</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cabinet Decision No. 91 of 2023 on the Application of Reverse Charge Mechanism on Electronic Devices among Registrants in the State for the purposes of Value Added Tax (VAT) introduces a distinct VAT treatment for certain supplies related to Electronic Devices and requires both recipient and supplier to implement a number of compliance requirements.</li>
                  <li>This Public Clarification aims to clarify the legislative updates, goods in scope, and practical implications of the new compliance requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Registrants supplying Electronic Devices to other registrants who intend to use them for resale or manufacturing will not account for VAT. Instead, the recipient will account for Due Tax under the reverse charge mechanism.</li>
                  <li>If the conditions under Cabinet Decision No. 91 are not met, the supplier must account for VAT, and the recipient may be unable to recover input tax under Article 54(1) of Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017.</li>
                  <li>Cabinet Decision No. 91 was issued under Article 48(8) of the Decree-Law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Recipient Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Before the date of supply (per Articles 25 or 26), the recipient must provide:

                <h4>Movement of Goods to Designated Zones</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Article 30(3) of the Executive Regulation states that a movement of goods into a Designated Zone from a place in the UAE or a supply of goods to a Designated Zone shall not be considered an export of those goods and can, therefore, not be eligible for the zero-rate as applicable to the exports of goods.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A supply of Electronic Devices from the UAE mainland to a Designated Zone, or a movement of such goods from the UAE mainland to a Designated Zone, shall not fall under the exception as provided under Article 2(2) of Cabinet Decision No. 91, and all other relevant provisions of this decision will apply.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hence, the supply shall also be subject to the provisions of Cabinet Decision No. 91.</p>

                <h4>Date Cabinet Decision No. 91 Comes into Effect</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>To allow Registrants to prepare for the additional compliance requirements, Cabinet Decision No. 91 becomes effective after 60 days from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Since the Decision was published in the Official Gazette on 30 August 2023, the date it comes into effect is 30 October 2023.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>All supplies of Electronic Devices with a date of supply of 30 October 2023 or later shall be subject to the VAT treatment and compliance requirements as clarified in this Public Clarification.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>This may result in suppliers and registered recipients having to apply two different VAT treatments and meet different compliance obligations within the same VAT reporting period.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <p>This Public Clarification states the position of the FTA and neither amends nor seeks to amend any provision of the aforementioned legislation. Therefore, it is effective as of the date of implementation of the relevant legislation, unless stated otherwise.</p>
