            <h2>VAT Public Clarification</h2>
            <h3>Profit margin scheme &ndash; eligible goods</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>It is important that businesses properly identify those goods which qualify to be sold under the
                profit margin scheme, in the context of transitional periods where &lsquo;second hand&rsquo; goods may
                not have been subject to VAT prior to implementation of VAT in the UAE.</p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Only those goods which have <b>previously been subject to VAT </b>before the supply in question
                may be subject to the profit margin scheme. As a result, stock on hand of used goods which were acquired
                prior to the effective date of Federal Decree-Law No.</p>
            <p>(8) on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT law&rdquo;), or which have not previously been subject to VAT for
                other
                reasons, are not eligible to be sold under the profit margin scheme.</p>
            <p>VAT is therefore due on the full selling price of such goods.</p>
            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p><i>Goods which qualify to be supplied under the profit margin scheme:</i></p>
            <p>Only certain goods are eligible to be supplied under the profit margin scheme. Those goods are
                listed below, but may only be supplied under the scheme where they were
                <b>subject to VAT before the supply</b> which shall be subject to the profit margin scheme:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Second hand goods, meaning tangible moveable
                        property that is suitable for further use as it is or after repair;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Antiques i.e. goods that are over 50 years old;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Collectors&rsquo; items i.e. stamps, coins, currency and other pieces of scientific, historical
                        or archaeological interest.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Conditions to apply the profit margin scheme:</i></p>
            <p>A VAT registered business may apply the profit margin scheme to eligible goods in the following
                circumstances:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>The goods must have been purchased from either:</p>
                    <ul class="dashed">
                        <li>
                            <p>A person who is not registered for VAT; or</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A taxable person who calculated VAT on the supply by reference to the profit margin i.e.
                                a VAT registered business which already applied the profit margin scheme on the same
                                goods.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The taxable person made a supply of the goods where input tax was not recovered in accordance
                        with Article 53 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>A taxable person will not be allowed to apply the profit margin scheme in such cases where he has
                issued a tax invoice or any other document mentioning an amount of VAT chargeable in respect of
                the supply.</p>
            <p><i>Goods purchased prior to the introduction of VAT:</i></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, it is a requirement of Article 29(2) of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 that
                the goods which are eligible to be sold under the profit margin scheme are those which have
                previously been subject to tax. As a result, goods which would ordinarily be eligible to be included
                within the scheme, but which were purchased during a period in which they would not have been subject to
                VAT, are not eligible for the scheme.</p>

            <p>As mentioned above, a supplier should be confident that
                a good has previously been subject to tax in
                order to apply the profit margin scheme. Such
                evidence or information of this position could
                include but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                        use
                        e.g. in the case of a car, the date the car was first registered would indicate its sale
                        would have been subject to VAT if it was registered on a date
                        after 1 January 2018;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Evidence that the supplier paid VAT on their original purchase e.g. by asking the
                        supplier for a copy of the tax invoice relating to their purchase of the good.</p>
