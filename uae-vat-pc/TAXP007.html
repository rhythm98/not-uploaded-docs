                  <li>The business address from which any activities are conducted.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>To encourage compliance, a grace period has been established from 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2025.</li>

                  <li>If a penalty was imposed between 1 January 2024 and the grace period implementation date, it will be reversed.</li>
                  <li>Where penalties have already been paid, the amount will be credited back to the registrant's tax account.</li>
                  <li>No action is required by registrants for reversal; the process is automatic.</li>
