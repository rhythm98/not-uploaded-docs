                <h4>Issue</h4>
                <p>Article 55 of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&quot;VAT Law&quot;) prescribes the time-period within which input tax should be recovered by a taxable person.</p>
                <p>This Public Clarification clarifies the FTA&#39;s position relating to the interpretation of Article 55 of the VAT Law and discusses the time-period within which the input tax must be recovered. It also outlines the recourse available to taxable persons in cases where input tax is not recovered within the prescribed time-period.</p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following two conditions are satisfied:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tax invoice is received; and</li>
                    <li>An intention is formed to make the payment of consideration for the supply before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Upon receipt of a tax invoice, a taxable person can recover input tax only when an intention to make the payment within a prescribed period is formed. If the intention to pay is formed in a tax period later than the one in which the tax invoice is received, the input tax may only be recovered in that later period.</p>

                <h4>Detailed Discussion</h4>
                <p>Article 55(1) of the VAT Law prescribes that input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The taxable person receives the tax invoice; and</li>
                    <li>The taxable person pays the consideration for the supply or any part thereof.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Article 54(2) of Cabinet Decision No. (52) of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&quot;VAT Executive Regulations&quot;) refers to Article 55(1) of the VAT Law. It provides that a taxable person is treated as having made a payment of consideration to the extent that they intend to make the payment before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment for the supply.</p>

                <h4>Detailed Clarification</h4>
                <p>A concurrent reading of Article 55(1) of the VAT Law and Article 54 of the VAT Executive Regulations provides that input tax must be recovered in the first tax period in which the following two conditions are satisfied:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tax invoice is received; and</li>
                    <li>There is an intention to make the payment of consideration of the supply before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A taxable person may receive a tax invoice but may not have an intention to make the payment until the internal approval process is completed. In such cases, the conditions of Article 55(1) are not satisfied because the intention to pay within the six-month period has not been formed.</p>
                <p>The FTA considers that the conditions under Article 55(1) will be met only when the internal approval process is completed and an intention to make the payment within the prescribed period is formed.</p>
                <p>Therefore, before recovering input tax, the taxable person must substantiate that in addition to receiving the tax invoice, the intention to make the payment within the prescribed period has also been formed.</p>
                <p>To avoid doubt: if a tax invoice is received in one tax period but the intention to pay is formed in a later period, the input tax can only be recovered in that later tax period.</p>
                <p>If the input tax is not recovered in the tax period where both conditions are met, the taxable person can recover the input tax in the immediate next tax period.</p>
                <p>If input tax is not recovered in the first two eligible tax periods, the taxable person is required to submit a voluntary disclosure. This disclosure should amend the input tax reported in the VAT return for one of those two periods.</p>

                <h4>Non-Payment Before Six-Month Expiry</h4>
                <p>Where a taxable person fails to make the payment of consideration before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment, the taxable person must reduce the input tax in the VAT return of the period following the expiry of the six-month period.</p>
                <p>However, once the payment is eventually made, the taxable person becomes entitled to recover the input tax again.</p>

                <p>Where a taxable person fails to make the payment of consideration before the expiration of six months after the agreed date of payment, the taxable person should reduce the input tax in the VAT Return of the tax period following the expiry of the six-month period.</p>
                <p>However, once the payment is made, the taxable person will again be entitled to recover the input tax.</p>
