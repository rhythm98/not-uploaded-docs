            <h3>VAT Public Clarification</h3>
            <h3>Bank Interest and Dividends</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>A VAT registered person may earn interest income by depositing money in a bank account or by holding
                fixed
                deposits, recurring deposits, or any other similar bank deposit. In addition, a VAT registered person
                may
                earn dividend income by holding shares in a company.</p>
            <p>This Public Clarification discusses the VAT implications of the interest income generated from bank
                deposits
                and dividend income.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Passively earned interest income generated from bank deposits does not amount to consideration for a
                supply.
                Similarly, dividend income received by merely holding shares in a company does not constitute
                consideration
                for a supply.</p>
            <p>Passively earned interest income from bank deposits and dividend income are, therefore, outside the scope
                of
                VAT, and there is no requirement to report them in the VAT return.</p>

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p>Value Added Tax ('VAT') is a tax imposed on the import and supply of goods and services at each stage of
                production and distribution, including deemed supplies.</p>
            <p>"Supply" is the foundation of VAT, and therefore, VAT implications arise only when there is a supply. In
                other words, if there is no supply, there is no VAT implication.</p>
            <p>A supply can be made of either goods or services. The terms taxable supply, supply of goods and supply of
                services have been accorded specific definitions under the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value
                Added
                Tax ("VAT Law") and Cabinet Decision No. (52) of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the Federal
                Decree-Law
                No (8) of 2017 on Value Added Tax ("Executive Regulations"). Where any transaction falls outside the
                scope
                of these definitions, it falls outside the scope of VAT.</p>
            <p>Article (42) of the Executive Regulations sets out the tax treatment of financial services. The Article
                states that the payment or collection of any amount of interest and dividend is considered to be a
                financial
                service and exempt from VAT. However, this only applies where there is in fact a supply.</p>

            <h3>Interest income from bank deposits</h3>
            <p>Bank deposits may accrue interest to their holders. For example, a retail business may put its business
                income into a bank account and earn interest on the deposited amount. The business does not do anything
                to
                earn this interest income other than to merely deposit the money in the account, and therefore, it can
                be
                said to be earned passively.</p>
            <p>In this case, the retail business does not make a supply to the bank, and therefore the interest income
                received is not a consideration for a supply. The retail business is not required to declare this income
                on
                its VAT return, as it is outside the scope of VAT.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that the above position only applies to interest derived from bank deposits and
                does
                not have any bearing to the interest generated from extending loans or credit, which are exempt supplies
                for
                VAT purposes.</p>

            <h3>Dividend income</h3>
            <p>The payment of a dividend by a company is a distribution of its profits to its shareholders. The holder
                of a
                share is, however, not entitled to a dividend until the company has declared a dividend.</p>
            <p>A dividend income accrues to the shareholder by merely holding shares in a company. If the company makes
                profits, and declares profits, the shareholder receives a dividend. The shareholder does not make any
                supply
                in order to be eligible for a payment of dividend. In other words, a dividend is generally a passive
                income.
            </p>
            <p>As the shareholder does not make a supply to receive the dividend, the dividend income cannot be treated
                as
                consideration for a supply. Accordingly, dividend income is outside the scope of VAT, and is therefore,
                not
                required to be reported on the VAT return.</p>
            <p>While dividend income is generally outside the scope of VAT, any amount charged as a "management fee"
                would
                be subject to VAT. For example, management fees charged by a holding company to its subsidiaries would
                be
                subject to VAT.</p>
