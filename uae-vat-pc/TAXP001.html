        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 amends certain penalties applicable to violations listed in the
          Tables appended to Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of tax
          laws in the UAE (collectively referred to as &ldquo;Cabinet Decision&rdquo;).
        </p>

        <h4>Detailed
          discussion</h4>
        <em>Background</em>
        <p>The UAE
          introduced Excise Tax and VAT with effect from 1 October 2017 and 1 January 2018, respectively.</p>

        <p>
          In order to offer consistency in the administration of different taxes, a set of common tax
          procedures concerning the rights and obligations of the FTA and taxpayers has been developed and
          prescribed in Federal tax procedures legislation, including in Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax
          Procedures (&ldquo;FTP Law&rdquo;). These Federal tax procedures apply to all Federal taxes under the
          jurisdiction of the FTA.</p>
        <p>
          Article 25 of the FTP Law <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup> specifies a number of violations which are
          subject to administrative penalties. This Article also directs the Cabinet to issue a decision that
          specifies administrative penalties for each of the violations listed in the Article, on condition
          that each of such penalties cannot be less than AED 500 for any violation and cannot exceed three
          times the amount of tax in respect
          of which the penalty was levied.</p>

        <p>
          The specific penalties for each violation are prescribed in the Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017,
          which was issued on 24 September 2017. These penalties have been applied to violations since the introduction
          of the VAT and Excise Taxes.</p>
        <p>
          On 28 April 2021, the Cabinet has issued the Decision No. 49 of 2021, which amends some of the
          administrative penalties applicable on the violations stated in Tables appended to Cabinet Decision
          No. 40 of 2017. This Public Clarification discusses some of the more significant amendments in more
          detail to ensure that there is certainty regarding the application of these amended penalties.</p>

        <p>
          The first part of this Public Clarification lists the administrative penalties, while the second
          part of this Public Clarification discusses administrative penalties in Table 1 annexed to Cabinet
          Decision No. 40 of 2017 and its
          amendments where the mechanism
          of calculation has been changed.</p>
        <p>
          Details relating to the redetermination of administrative penalties in accordance with the Third
          Article of Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 are discussed in the Tax Procedures Public Clarification
          <em>&ldquo;TAXP002 - Redetermination of Administrative Penalties Levied Prior to the Effective Date of
            Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021&rdquo;</em>, available on the FTA&apos;s website.

        <h3>Part 2:
          Administrative Penalties in Table 1 annexed to
          the Cabinet Decision where the Mechanism of Calculation has been Changed</h3>
        <p><em>Violation 9</em></p>
        <p>
          Violation 9 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision imposes a penalty for failure of a taxable
          person to settle the payable tax stated in the submitted tax return or voluntary disclosure, or the
          tax assessment that the taxable person was notified of, within the timeframe specified in the Tax
          Law.</p>
        <p>The amended
          penalties imposed on the taxable person are
          as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              2% penalty on the amount of unsettled tax, due on the day
              following the due date of payment.</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>
              4% monthly penalty is due after one month from the original due date of payment, then on the
              same date monthly thereafter. This penalty is imposed on the amount which is still unsettled on the
              corresponding date each month.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, where a taxable person failed to pay due tax by 28 June in respect of its tax return
          for the tax period ending in May, the late payment penalty of 2% will be imposed on 29 June on the
          amount of unsettled tax. Where such tax amount or part of it is still outstanding on 28 July, the
          amount outstanding will be subject to the monthly penalty of 4%. Such 4% penalty will again be
          imposed on any unsettled tax amounts on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of each subsequent
          month up to 300% of the tax amount in respect of which the penalty is levied.</p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that, for the purposes of this penalty, the deadline for payment of additional
          tax resulting from a voluntary disclosure is 20 business days from the date of submission of the
          voluntary disclosure. Consequently, the 2% penalty will be imposed on the amount of unsettled tax on
          the first day following the 20<sup>th</sup> business day from the date the voluntary disclosure is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the deadline for payment of additional tax in the case of a tax assessment is 20 business
          days from the date on which the tax assessment was received. Hence, the 2% penalty will be imposed
          on the amount of unsettled tax on the first day following the 20th business day from the date the
          tax assessment is received.
        </p>
        <p>This means
          that a late payment penalty will not be imposed in
          respect of additional amounts of tax payable to the FTA by a taxable person following a voluntary disclose or
          a tax assessment, where the person has settled such due tax prior to the due
          date of payment, i.e. 20 business days from the date of submitting a voluntary disclosure or
          receiving a tax assessment. However, once the deadline for settlement of tax has passed, the penalty
          will be imposed as described
          above.</p>

        <p>
          Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 provides a special mechanism to determine the date on which the
          penalty shall be imposed in respect of monthly penalties. The mechanism is discussed in detail in a
          following section in this Public Clarification.</p>

        <p><em>Violation 10</em></p>
        <p>
          Violation 10 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision imposes a penalty on the Registrant upon submitting an
          incorrect tax
          return.</p>

        <p>
          Whenever an error is made in a tax return, a fixed penalty will first apply. This penalty is AED
          1,000 for the first violation and AED 2,000 for any repeated violation.
        </p>

        <p>
          It should be noted that where the incorrect tax return results in a tax difference which is less
          than the fixed penalty amount of AED 1,000 or AED 2,000, as the case may be, the FTA will impose a
          penalty equal to higher of the tax difference and AED 500.</p>

        <p>Furthermore,
          the fixed penalty will not be imposed on anyone
          who corrects their tax return prior to the due date for submission of the return.</p>
        <p>Violation 11</p>
        <p>
          Violation 11 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision imposes a penalty where a person/taxpayer
          submits a voluntary disclosure on errors in the tax return, tax assessment or refund application
          pursuant to Article 10(1) and 10(2) of the FTP Law <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup>. As such, this penalty
          is imposed where payable tax per the tax return or tax assessment, has been calculated at a value
          less than the required by the tax legislation, or where tax which the person is entitled to recover
          has been calculated at a value higher than the
          entitlement as per the legislation.</p>
        <p>
          The penalty on Violation 11 is imposed in addition to the penalty imposed on Violation 10 of Table 1
          annexed to the Cabinet Decision. This penalty is a percentage-based penalty which is applied on the
          difference between the tax that was calculated and that which should have
          been calculated, as follows:</p>

        <p>
          For example, a person/taxpayer submits a voluntary disclosure to correct a tax return, tax
          assessment, or a tax refund application, where the difference to be settled to the FTA resulting
          from that voluntary disclosure is AED 100,000. The voluntary disclosure was relating to an error in
          a tax return, tax assessment, or a tax refund application dated 1 September 2021. The penalty will
          be imposed on Violation 11 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision according to the
          following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If the person/taxpayer submits the voluntary disclosure in the period between 2 September
              2021 and 1 September 2022, the penalty imposed on Violation 11 will be 5% of the AED 100,000, which is
              equivalent to AED 5,000.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the person/taxpayer submits the voluntary disclosure in the period between 2 September
              2022 and 1 September 2023, the penalty imposed on Violation 11 will be 10% of the AED 100,000, which is
              equivalent to AED 10,000.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the person/taxpayer submits the voluntary disclosure in the period between 2 September
              2023 and 1 September 2024, the penalty imposed on Violation 11 will be 20% of the AED 100,000, which is
              equivalent to AED 20,000.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the person/taxpayer submits the voluntary disclosure in the period between 2 September
              2024 and 1 September 2025, the penalty imposed on Violation 11 will be 30% of the AED 100,000, which is
              equivalent to AED 30,000.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If the person/taxpayer submits the voluntary disclosure on or after 2 September 2025, the
              penalty imposed on Violation 11 will be 40% of the AED 100,000, which is equivalent to AED 40,000.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Since the amount of the penalty increases as it takes longer for the person to submit a voluntary
          disclosure, the new rules reward the timely disclosure of errors.</p>

        <p><em>Violation 12</em></p>
        <p>
          Violation 12 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision imposes a penalty for the failure of the
          person/taxpayer to voluntarily disclose an error in the tax
          return, tax assessment or refund application pursuant to Article 10(1) and 10(2) of the FTP Law, before being
          notified that it will be subject to
          a tax audit. As such, this penalty is imposed where payable tax per the tax return or tax
          assessment, has been calculated at a value less than the required by the tax legislation, or where
          tax which the person is entitled to recover has been calculated at a value higher than the
          entitlement as per the legislation.</p>

        <p>
          Where this penalty applies, it will be imposed on the person in addition to the penalty imposed as
          per Violation 10 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision as follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>A penalty
              of 50% on the amount of error.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Any of
              the following penalties as the case may be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A penalty of 4% of the tax unsettled to the FTA, for every month or part of the month from
                  the date the payment is due for the relevant tax period until the date of receipt of the tax
                  assessment.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A penalty of 4% of the tax that was not returned to the FTA due to an ineligible refund, for
                  every month or part of the month from the date of tax refund until the date of receipt of
                  the tax assessment.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Violation 14</p>
        <p>Violation 14
          of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision imposes a penalty for failure of the registrant to calculate tax on
          behalf of another person when
          the registered taxable person is obliged to do so
          under any Tax Law.</p>

        <p>
          The penalty imposed on the responsible registrant is similar to the penalty which would be imposed
          on the underlying taxable person under Violation 9 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision. Thus, the
          responsible registrant is obliged to pay a penalty
          applicable to the late payment of payable tax as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              2% penalty on the amount of the unsettled tax is due on the first day following the due date
              of payment, where the settlement of payable tax is late.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              4% monthly penalty which is due after one month from the due date of payment, then on the
              same date of every month thereafter, on the amount of tax which is still unsettled on those dates.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For the purposes of this penalty, the deadline for payment of tax in the case of the voluntary
          disclosure or a tax assessment is 20 working days from the date of submission or receipt,
          respectively. Hence, in such cases, the trigger date of the penalty on the unsettled Tax would be
          the first day following the 20<sup>th</sup> business day from the date of submitting
          the voluntary disclosure or the date of receiving the tax assessment, as the case
          may be.</p>

        <p>Cabinet
          Decision No. 49 of 2021 provides a special mechanism
          to determine the date on which the penalty shall be imposed in respect of monthly penalties. The mechanism is
          discussed in the following section of this Public Clarification.</p>

        <p>
          <em>Mechanism to Specify the Date of Imposition of some Penalties</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 provides in its Second Article <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a>
          </sup> a mechanism
          that clarifies how to specify the date of penalty imposition for penalties imposed on the same date
          monthly. For the purpose of the imposition of penalties on violations No. 4, 9, and 14 of Table 1
          annexed to the Cabinet Decision, Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 takes into consideration the
          difference in the number of days of the calendar months.</p>
        <p>
          As per the mechanism specified in the Second Article of Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021, the date of
          the monthly penalty is specified as follows:</p>




        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Where the new month includes a date corresponding to the date the penalty was originally
              imposed on, the date on which the penalty will be imposed in the new month is the date it was originally
              imposed the first time.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Where a month does not include a date corresponding to the date the penalty was originally
              imposed on, the date on which the penalty will be imposed for the such month will be the
              first day of the following month. However, for the month following the month which did not include
              a corresponding date, the penalty shall be imposed
              on the date corresponding to the date the
              penalty was originally imposed.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, if a penalty that is due on the same date monthly was imposed for any of violations No.
          4, 9, or 14 of Table 1 annexed to the Cabinet Decision on 30 January, as February does not include a
          30th day, the date the penalty is imposed for February would be 1 March. However, as March includes
          a 30th day, March&apos;s penalty will be imposed on the 30th of March.</p>
