            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>
                Article 44 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the
                Executive Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law
                No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;Executive
                Regulations&rdquo;) describes the definition of &ldquo;bare
                land&rdquo; for the purposes of the exemption from VAT
                set out in Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on
                Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT Law&rdquo;). Article 37 of the
                Executive Regulations describes the definition of
                &ldquo;residential building&rdquo; for the purposes of the zero-
                rating (in respect of the first supply) and the
                exemption from VAT as set out in the VAT Law.

            <p>
                The VAT Real Estate Guide provides some clarity on
                the interpretation of these provisions in the
                context of farm houses and farm land. The FTA is
                aware of a number of circumstances whereby
                additional clarity has been sought on the VAT
                status of farm houses and farm land.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                It is often necessary to consider each supply on its
                individual facts where farm land and buildings are
                concerned. However, there are a number of
                principles which can be applied when discussing
                the VAT treatment of supplies (by way of sale or
                lease) of both farm land and farm buildings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Farm houses which meet the conditions to be
                        treated as a residential building should be
                        exempt from VAT (or zero-rated in the case of
                        the first supply after construction). A building
                        will typically be a residential building where it
                        is occupied by a person as their principal place
                        of residence;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Other farm buildings not intended to be used
                        as a principal place of residence will be subject
                        to the standard rate of VAT. This would include
                        farm houses which are not used by a person as
                        their principal place of residence, e.g. houses
                        used as weekend homes only;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Farm land which is considered &lsquo;covered&rsquo; with
                        buildings or civil engineering works should be
                        subject to VAT at the standard rate;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Farm land which is considered &lsquo;bare land&rsquo;, i.e.
                        the plot has no buildings or civil engineering
                        work (not even in-built irrigation etc), should
                        be exempt from VAT; and
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The supply of a farm as a whole should be
                        considered in light of the rules regarding
                        composite or mixed supplies and any
                        consideration apportioned appropriately
                        where applicable.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p><i>Farm houses:</i></p>
            <p>
                The VAT Real Estate Guide explains that where
                farm houses are located on agricultural land, they
                will be considered to be residential buildings where
                they are occupied, or intended to be occupied, as
                a person&rsquo;s principal place of residence and meet
                the conditions to be treated as a residential
                building.
            </p>
            <p>
                In accordance with the Executive Regulations and
                the explanation provided within the VAT Real
                Estate guide, a farm house shall not be considered
                to be a residential building where it is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Any place that is not a building fixed to the
                        ground and which can be moved without being
                        damaged;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Any building that is used as a hotel, motel, bed
                        and breakfast establishment, or hospital or the
                        like;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        A serviced apartment for which services in
                        addition to the supply of accommodation are
                        provided;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Any building constructed or converted without
                        lawful authority.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Where a farm house is used as a weekend
                        home of a family, it is not to be the principal
                        place of residence and therefore is not a
                        residential building.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Where a part of a farm house is used solely as
                        a principal place of residence of a person, and
                        another part of the farm house is used as a
                        motel, the part of the house which is used as a
                        principal place of residence may qualify as a
                        residential building, provided the other
                        conditions are met.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Where a farm house meets the definition of a
                residential building, the first supply of such a farm
                house within 3 years of its completion shall be
                zero-rated for VAT purposes. Any subsequent
                supply (including both sale or lease) shall be
                exempt from VAT.
            </p>
            <p><i>Other farm buildings:</i></p>
            <p>
                Where buildings are situated on agricultural land
                which do not meet the conditions above, they shall
                be treated as commercial buildings. For example, a
                farm house may be used as a non-principal place of
                residence of a person (e.g. only used on
                weekends), or a building may be used for a
                commercial farm-related purpose (e.g. barns,
                livestock sheds, granaries, stables etc. As a result of
                being considered to be commercial buildings, the
                lease or sale of such farm buildings should be
                subject to VAT at the standard rate.
            </p>
            <p><i>Commercial farm land:</i></p>
            <p>
                The VAT treatment of the supply of plots of farm
                land, e.g. fields etc, on which no buildings are
                situated, is dependent on whether the land is
                considered to be &ldquo;bare land&rdquo; for the purposes of
                Article 44 of the Executive Regulations. As a result,
                it is important that each supply is considered on its
                own individual facts in order to determine the
                correct VAT treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The VAT Real Estate Guide clarifies that farm land
                will normally be considered to be commercial land,
                i.e. not &ldquo;bare&rdquo; land, as it will normally be covered
                with infrastructure or civil engineering works
                required to make it operational as a farm e.g.
                irrigation systems, roads, utility connections etc.
                Farm land which has been developed to this degree
                would normally be expected to be used for
                commercial purposes i.e. the operation of a
                farming business. As such, the supply of any such
                commercial farm land would be subject to VAT at
                the standard rate.
            </p>
            <p><i>Non-commercial farm land:</i></p>
            <p>
                Land which is not used for commercial farming
                activities, but which is used for private farming
                purposes such as the growing of crops or grazing
                for livestock, may also qualify as &lsquo;commercial&rsquo; farm
                land if it is covered by completed or partially
                completed buildings or civil engineering works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where such farm land is not &lsquo;covered land&rsquo; and has
                merely been &lsquo;developed&rsquo; or &lsquo;worked&rsquo; for the
                purposes of growing crops, with no civil
                engineering works built into the land in order to
                facilitate that activity, then it is likely the land
                should be considered to be bare land. In such
                cases, the supply of the farm land by way of either
                sale or lease should be exempt from VAT.
            </p>
            <p><i>Supply of a farm:</i></p>
            <p>
                The VAT treatment of a supply of a farm as a whole,
                comprising both commercial land, commercial
                buildings and residential buildings, should be
                considered on the basis of whether it is a single
                composite supply (and therefore subject to the
                VAT liability of the principal component), or
                whether it is a mixed supply (and therefore the
                individual components are subject to different VAT
                treatments). In order to determine the correct VAT
                liability, each case will need to be considered on a
                case by case basis because the fact patterns will
                differ.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, the supplier is expected to identify the
                following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Whether the supply is a single composite
                        supply or multiple supplies; and</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The VAT treatment of each supply being made.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Where a supplier is making a single composite
                supply of a farm where different elements of the
                farm are used for different taxable and non-taxable
                purposes, the supplier may need to identify the
                predominant usage of the farm and apply that VAT
                treatment to the whole supply. Again, this
                determination needs to be made on a case by case
                basis. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If the main use of a farm is as a principal place
                        of residence of a family, with the farm land
                        being used for personal enjoyment of the
                        family, the supply of a residential building would
                        likely be the predominant purpose and
                        therefore the whole supply would be exempt
                        from VAT.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If a commercial farm has a residential building
                        which permanently accommodates the
                        manager of the farm and his or her family, the
                        use of the farm for commercial purposes would
                        likely be a main component of the supply, and
                        therefore the sale would in principle be subject
                        to VAT.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As explained in the VAT Real Estate Guide where a
                farm is supplied which is not considered to be a
                single composite supply, the VAT liability should be
                apportioned. An indicator that the supply is not a
                single composite supply could be the separate
                identification of prices for different parts of the
                farm, specified in the sale contract. This would
                mean that the value of the consideration received
                for the residential part of the farm (i.e. a farm
                house) should be treated as exempt from VAT and
                the value of consideration relating to the
                commercial part of the farm (i.e. covered land,
                commercial buildings) should be treated as
                standard rated.
