      <h3>VAT Public Clarification</h3>
      <h3>Mobile Phones, Airtime, and Data Packages Made Available to Employees for Business Use</h3>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>
          Many businesses enter into agreements with telecommunication service providers to make mobile phones
          (&ldquo;Phones&rdquo;), airtime (&ldquo;Airtime&rdquo;) (i.e. call minutes) and data packages (&ldquo;Packages&rdquo;), available to
          their employees to perform their roles outside office hours or at locations away from the office.
          Due to COVID-19, there has been an increase in work-from-home arrangements, resulting in some
          instances where employers pay for Phones, Airtime, and Packages&apos; expenses to allow employees to perform
          their roles remotely.</p>

        <p>
          Due to the potential private use of Phones, Airtime, and Packages, there has been uncertainty as to
          whether a business is entitled to recover the related input tax and, if so, what the requirements are to
          be entitled to input tax recovery.</p>

        <p>
          This Public Clarification provides guidance on the application of the VAT legislation in respect of
          the recovery of input tax incurred on Phones, Airtime, and Packages acquired for
          business use.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          In instances where an employer acquires Phones, Airtime, and Packages for use by its employees
          solely for business purposes and has a strict policy in place to restrict the use of such Phones,
          Airtime, and Packages to business purposes, the right to use the Phones, Airtime, and Packages would
          not constitute a personal benefit for the employee, provided the value of the Airtime and Packages
          was determined based on actual historical business usage. Note that backdated policies shall not be
          accepted.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
        <em>Input Tax Recovery &ndash; General Rule</em>
        <p>A
          taxable person may generally recover input tax paid for goods and services used (or intended to be used) for
          making taxable
          supplies. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>
          The right to recover input tax is, however, limited in instances provided for in the Executive
          Regulation, regardless of whether the cost was incurred to make taxable supplies. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup></p>


        <em>Non-permissible Recovery of Input Tax</em>
        <p>
          Article 53(1)(c) of the Executive Regulation <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup> prohibits the recovery of
          input tax incurred on goods or services purchased to be used by an employee for their personal
          benefit without any charge
          to the employee, unless there is a legal or contractual
          obligation on the employer to provide such service in order for the employee to perform their role, or it is a
          deemed

        <p>
          In instances where an employer acquires Phones, Airtime, and Packages solely for business purposes
          and has a strict policy in place to restrict the use of such Phones, Airtime, and Packages to
          business purposes, the right to use Phones, Airtime, and Packages would not constitute a personal
          benefit for the employee.</p>
        <em>Solely for Business Use</em>
        <p>
          Article 53(1)(c) of the Executive Regulation does not apply where a taxable person can prove that
          the Phones, Airtime, and Packages are used solely for business purposes. In addition to having a
          documented policy on the restricted use of Phones, Airtime, and Packages, the business would be
          required to demonstrate that it monitors the use of Airtime, and Packages and takes appropriate
          action against employees who use the Phones, Airtime, and Packages for personal use in accordance with the
          documented policy.</p>

        <p>
          As part of monitoring the acceptable use of Phones, Airtime, and Packages, the taxable person shall
          consider the variance between the actual usage and the average Airtime and Packages used for the
          specific role of the employee business purposes. If the business acquires Airtime and Packages
          based on the expected business requirements, any Airtime and Packages used in excess of the business plan
          would be regarded as
          non-business use, unless the additional Airtime and Packages is recharged to the employee with
          output tax, or if there is robust monitoring in place to
          substantiate the actual use.</p>

        <p>
          As part of the documented policy, employees should be made aware of the repercussions of not abiding
          by the policy and the taxable person should retain proof of action taken against employees not
          complying with the documented policy.</p>

        <em>Input Tax Recovery Requirements</em>

        <p>
          Considering the above, a business is entitled to recover input tax in respect of Phones, Airtime,
          and Packages acquired if these costs are incurred to make taxable supplies and the following requirements are
          met:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The business is registered for VAT and acquired Phones, Airtime, and Packages in its own
              name, e.g. the business&apos; details
              are reflected on the tax
              invoices and contract with the service provider;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The business has a documented policy in place which clearly states that the Phones, Airtime,
              and Packages may only be used for business purposes, and the consequences of any personal use;</p>
          </li>



          <li>
            <p>
              The business regularly monitors the use of Airtime and Packages and retains justification for the
              variances;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The business takes action against employees using Phones, Airtime, and Packages for personal
              use in accordance with the</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The business takes action against employees using Phones, Airtime, and Packages for personal
              use in accordance with the documented policy; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The business retains valid tax invoices in respect of the Phones, Airtime, and Packages acquired.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that only documented policies which were already in place at the time the Phones, Airtime, and
          Packages were made available to the employee
          will be considered.</p>

        <p>
          If all of the above requirements are not met, the recovery of input tax incurred in respect of
          Phones, Airtime, and Packages will be blocked in accordance with Article 53(1)(c) of the Executive Regulation.
