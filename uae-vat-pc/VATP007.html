            <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>
                Article 34 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the
                Executive Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law
                No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT Executive
                Regulations&rdquo;) states the means of transport which
                qualify for zero-rating under Clause 4 of Article 45
                of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value
                Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT Law&rdquo;).
            </p>
            <p>
                One such qualifying means of transport includes
                the supply of a bus or train that is designed or
                adapted to be used for public transportation of 10
                or more passengers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Public Clarification shall discuss the definition
                of &lsquo;public transportation&rsquo; and its interpretation for
                the purposes of identifying those buses or trains
                which qualify to be supplied at the zero rate under
                this provision.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the avoidance of doubt, this Public Clarification
                impacts upon the VAT liability of the supply of the
                vehicles themselves, and does not affect the VAT
                liability of transportation services supplied under
                Clause 2 of Article 45 of the VAT Law (i.e.
                international transport of passengers and goods,
                which is zero-rated) or under Clause 4 of Article 46
                of the VAT Law (i.e. local passenger transport
                services, which is exempt from VAT). The
                conditions for applying the zero-rate or exemption
                to such transport services are covered in Article 33
                and Article 45 of the Executive Regulations
                respectively.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Only buses or trains which are designed or adapted
                to be used for the mass transport of individuals,
                without being restricted to a specific category of
                users, shall qualify to be supplied at the zero rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, those means of transport which are
                designed to transport a specific category of
                individuals, such as school students or employees
                of a business, do not meet the conditions to be
                treated as a qualifying means of transport for the
                purposes of the zero-rating provisions. Such means
                of transport shall therefore be subject to the
                standard rate of VAT.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether or not the original supply of the means of
                transport qualified for zero rating has no impact on
                the VAT liability of any charges made for the supply
                of transportation services. The VAT liability of
                supplying transportation services shall be
                determined based on whether the transportation
                is local (and therefore exempt from VAT) or
                international (and therefore zero rated).
            </p>
            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p><i>Public transportation:</i></p>
            <p>
                Clause 3 of Article 34 of the Executive Regulations
                states that the one of the categories of a means of
                transport which shall qualify for zero rating is as
                follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>A supply of a bus or train that is designed or
                adapted to be used for public transportation of
                10 or more passengers.</blockquote>
            <p>
                Clause 3 of Article 34 requires that the vehicle is
                actually used for public transportation, as well as
                being designed or adapted for such.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also necessary to consider the meaning of
                means of transport used for &lsquo;private
                transportation&rsquo; of individuals, which the FTA
                interprets as:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                All means of transportation used to transport a
                specific group of people under contracts.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In contrast, means of transport used for &lsquo;public
                transportation&rsquo; shall be interpreted by the FTA as:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                All means of mass transportation used to
                transport all individuals without specifying any
                category.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The difference between the two forms of
                transportation therefore means that public
                transportation should be available for all
                individuals without exception. Public
                transportation would not include transportation
                which is only available to a specific category of
                user.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, only those buses or trains which are
                openly available for use by any person without
                exception should be considered to be designed or
                adapted for <strong>public transportation</strong> and may
                therefore qualify to be supplied at the zero rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a bus or train is designed or adapted for a specific
                class or group of people, or is only available for use
                by a specific class or group of people, it shall be
                considered to be designed or adapted for use for
                <strong>private transportation</strong>. As a result, the supply of
                those vehicles shall be subject to VAT at the
                standard rate.
            </p>
            <p><i>Features of public transportation:</i></p>
            <p>
                In order to determine whether a bus or train is
                designed or adapted for use for public
                transportation the FTA considers the following
                factors would be indicative, amongst others:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Features exist which allow passengers to pay
                        for the transportation or to indicate they
                        possess a ticket e.g. a payment booth, ticket
                        scanner or device to take payment;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There is branding either within or outside the
                        vehicle advertising the transport service,
                        indicating the transportation is available to all;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There is branding or other features indicating
                        regulation of the means of transport by the
                        entity regulating public transportation in the
                        Emirate of operation;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There is evidence that the means of transport
                        is required to comply with certain provisions or
                        specifications, or there is a requirement to pay
                        for a specific test determined by the entity
                        regulating public transportation in the Emirate
                        of operation, before being approved for use to
                        transport passengers;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Features exist which allow the placement of
                        advertising materials by third parties on or
                        within the means of transport;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The intended use of the means of transport is
                        to transport members of the public without
                        exception or limitation to a specific group.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Application to specific circumstances:</i></p>
            <p>
                Based on the above, the following means of
                transport shall not be considered to be used for
                public transportation and the supply of such means
                shall be subject to VAT at the standard rate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>School buses;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Buses used to transport groups of employees
                        or workers to or from a place of work;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Shuttle buses used to transport hotel guests to
                        other locations e.g. a mall, airport, park, or
                        other tourist attraction.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The examples above are not considered to be used
                for public transportation on the basis that their use
                is restricted to one particular group of people,
                rather than the general public, for example, school
                students, employees of a business or hotel guests.
            </p>
            <p><i>VAT liability of transportation services:</i></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the VAT treatment of the
                means of transport when purchased <strong>does not</strong>
                determine the VAT treatment of any supply of
                transport services made using that vehicle.</p>
            <p>
                Clause 2 of Article 45 of the VAT Law states that the
                international transport of passengers and goods
                which starts or ends in the UAE, or passes through
                the UAE, shall be zero-rated. As a result, any VAT
                incurred on costs directly related to the provision
                of such international transport services should be
                recoverable in full, subject to the normal input tax
                recovery conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clause 4 of Article 46 of the VAT Law and Article 45
                of the Executive Regulations state that any supply
                of local passenger transport shall be exempt from
                VAT where the supply is of local passenger
                transport services in a qualifying means of
                transport by land, water or air from a place in the
                UAE to another place in the UAE.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of the exemption, one of the
                qualifying means of transport listed includes a
                motor vehicle, including a taxi, bus, railway train,
                tram, mono-rail or similar means of transport,
                designed or adapted for transport of passengers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the definition of &ldquo;qualifying means of
                transport&rdquo; under Article 45 of the Executive
                Regulations requires only that the vehicle is
                designed or adapted for transport of passengers,
                rather than for public transportation, Article 45 is
                to be interpreted broadly as including the
                transport of any passengers, whether a defined
                group or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                VAT incurred on costs which directly relate to the
                provision of exempt local transport services are not
                recoverable. Therefore, where local transport is
                made for a charge to a defined group of people,
                rather than the general public, any VAT incurred on
                the costs of purchasing the means of transport,
                fuel etc. in order to provide that service is not
                recoverable.
