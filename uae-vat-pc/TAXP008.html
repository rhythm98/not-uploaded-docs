        <p>
          Federal Decree-Law No. 28 of 2022 on Tax Procedures and its amendments (&ldquo;Tax Procedures Law&rdquo;)
          introduced a new optional mechanism for persons to dispute tax assessments and related
          administrative penalties, before submitting a request for
          reconsideration.</p>

        <p>
          This Public Clarification clarifies the instances in which a person may submit a request for a tax
          assessment review.</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
          The purpose of the tax assessment review is to provide a process whereby a person can request a
          review of the tax assessment (or part thereof) as well as the related administrative penalties
          assessment <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark1' id='bookmarkback1'>[1]</a>
          </sup> by independent FTA&apos;s officials (i.e. FTA&apos;s officials that were
          not part of the team that conducted the tax audit) based on the facts and evidence provided by the
          person as well as the audit procedures conducted during the audit by the FTA.</p>

        <p>A person can
          request a tax assessment review if the person has reasonable grounds to believe that there were technical
          errors relating to the incorrect application of the relevant tax legislation or
          tax treaties, calculation errors or errors in audit procedures that led to an incorrect
          determination of tax
          differences and administrative penalties.</p>

        <p>
          If the person wishes to introduce new information or additional documentary evidence/facts that were
          not presented to the FTA auditors during the audit process, the tax assessment review mechanism is
          not the appropriate dispute channel. In such instances, the person may apply for reconsideration.

        <em>Tax
          Assessment Review Request</em>
        <p>
          A person may submit a request for the review of a tax assessment and the related administrative
          penalties assessment if the person can prove that the FTA did not follow the correct procedures or
          made an error in determining the amount of the tax assessment (and administrative penalties
          assessment, where applicable) based on the information and documents the person made available to tax audit&rdquo;.

        <p>
          The term &ldquo;during the tax audit&rdquo; refers to the period starting from the date the person receives the
          tax audit notification until the date the tax assessment and
          administrative penalty assessment are issued.</p>
        <p>If a
          person wants to request a tax assessment review, the request (including reasons for the request) must be
          submitted to the FTA within 40
          business days from the date the person is notified of the tax assessment and related administrative
          penalties. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark2' id='bookmarkback2'>[2]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>It is not
          permitted to submit a tax assessment review
          request in respect of which the person already applied for reconsideration. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark3' id='bookmarkback3'>[3]</a>
          </sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          The following are examples of instances where a person can apply for a tax assessment review,
          provided the request is submitted within the prescribed period:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Issuance of tax audit notifications for prescribed periods, e.g. issuing a tax assessment
              covering a 2018 tax period, however, the registrant was notified of the audit during 2024.
              According to the general statute of limitation rule, the FTA may not conduct a tax audit
              after the expiration of 5 years
              from the end of the relevant tax period. <sup>
                <a href='#bookmark4' id='bookmarkback4'>[4]</a>
              </sup></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Failure to notify the person of a tax audit prior to conducting the tax audit, and issuing a
              tax assessment.</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that the FTA depended/relied on undocumented/ uncertified confirmations
              by external parties in order to determine the value of the person&apos;s taxable supplies, on the
              basis of which the tax assessment was issued.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that the FTA failed to send a request
              for information, data or other supporting evidence, that could impact on the validity of the tax audit
              findings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that there were errors in determining
              the value of a supply.</p>


          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that there were errors in the mechanism used in calculating the excess inventory for
              Excise Tax
              purposes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that the issuance of estimated tax assessments was based on an incorrect estimation
              basis.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that there are calculation errors in accounting for/calculating the due tax.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that there were errors in the tax treatment of a transaction due to
              incomplete tax audit procedures or disregarding documents provided during the tax audit period.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that the issuance of a tax assessment
              was for tax periods not covered in the tax audit notification.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person believes that the FTA failed to send the tax audit results to the person&apos;s
              registereda ddress.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>




        <p>
          If the person is unable to submit the tax assessment review request within 40 business days, the
          person may request the FTA to extend the deadline for submitting the request, provided the
          person has valid reasons for not being able to meet the
          deadline for submission. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark5' id='bookmarkback5'>[5]</a>
          </sup></p>

        <p>
          A tax assessment review
          request may be submitted to the following email address: <a href="mailto:AssessmentReview@tax.gov.ae"
            target="_blank">AssessmentReview@tax.gov.ae</a>
        </p>

        <em>Review of the tax assessment</em>

        <p>
          If the person submitted the tax assessment review request within the prescribed period, the FTA
          shall consider the request and reasons provided by the person, and issue a decision within 40
          business days from receiving the request, <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a>
          </sup> unless the FTA notified the
          person that a longer period is needed to make the decision. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark7' id='bookmarkback7'>[7]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <p>The FTA may
          decide to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              reject the request if the procedural requirements are not met, e.g. if the request was not
              submitted within 40 business days after the person was notified of the tax assessment and
              administrative penalties assessment, or where new information was presented.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              adjust the previously issued tax assessment (and
              related administrative penalties assessment, where applicable),</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              uphold the previously issued tax assessment (and related administrative penalties assessment, where
              applicable).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The FTA
          shall inform the applicant of the decision within 5 business days from the date the decision is
          issued. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark6' id='bookmarkback6'>[6]</a>
          </sup></p>

        <p>
          If the person does not agree with the outcome of the tax assessment review, or if the decision is
          not issued within 40 business days (or a longer period where the person is notified of an
          extension), the person may submit a reconsideration request. <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark8' id='bookmarkback8'>[8]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <em>Reconsideration request</em>

        <p>
          A person may opt to forego the option to request a tax assessment review and submit a
          reconsideration request if the person wants to dispute the tax assessment and related administrative penalties
          assessment.</p>
        <p>
          The person may only submit a reconsideration request if that person already submitted a tax
          assessment review request after any of the following: <sup>
            <a href='#bookmark9' id='bookmarkback9'>[9]</a>
          </sup></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person received the tax assessment review decision
              and disagrees with the outcome, or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The FTA did not issue a decision on the matter within the prescribed period i.e. within 40
              business days from the date the person submitted the request for a tax assessment review (or
              a longer period where the person is notified of an
              extension).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>
          As part of the reconsideration process, the person may submit additional information and documentary
          evidence that were not available during
          the tax audit.</p>
