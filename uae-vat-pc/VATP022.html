            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>Law No. 6 of 2019 Concerning Ownership of Jointly Owned Real Property in the Emirate of Dubai ("Law No.
                6") was issued on 4 September 2019 and has a significant impact on Dubai Owners' Associations and
                Management Entities.</p>
            <p>As a result of Law No. 6, Dubai Owners' Associations no longer make taxable supplies and are, therefore,
                required to deregister for VAT. There are, however, numerous Dubai Owners' Associations that are still
                registered for VAT.</p>
            <p>This Public Clarification clarifies the VAT implications of Law No. 6 on Dubai Owners' Associations and
                Management Entities.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>On 3 November 2019, all rights and obligations of Dubai Owners' Associations were transferred to
                Management Entities, which resulted in Dubai Owners' Associations no longer making taxable supplies.</p>
            <p>Dubai Owners' Associations were, therefore, required to apply for VAT deregistration within the period
                prescribed in the tax legislation of 20 business days; that is, no later than 4 December 2019.</p>
            <p>Management Entities are regarded as making supplies to the owners of Jointly Owned Real Property and
                required to fulfill VAT obligations in this regard, including the issuing of valid tax invoices and VAT
                reporting.</p>

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p>In this clarification, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as "Decree-
                Law", Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of
                2017 on Value Added Tax and its amendments is referred to as "Executive Regulation", Federal Law No. 7
                of 2017 on Tax Procedures Tax is referred to as "Tax Procedures Law", and Cabinet Resolution No. 40 of
                2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws in the UAE is referred to as "Cabinet
                Resolution 40".</p>

            <h3>Law No. 6</h3>
            <p>Law No. 6 was published on 4 September 2019 and became effective 60 days thereafter; that is, on 3
                November 2019. This Law applies to all Master Projects and Jointly Owned Real Property in Dubai,
                including those in Special Development Zones and in free zones.</p>

            <p>Article 2 of Law No. 6 defines the term "Jointly Owned Real Property" as a building, including the parts
                and appurtenances allocated for common use, and the land on which that building is constructed; or land
                which is subdivided into units or land plots intended for individual ownership.</p>

            <p>The term "Management Entity" means an entity in charge of managing common facilities, Jointly Owned Real
                Property, or common parts in accordance with the provisions of this Law. This includes developers,
                management companies, or hotel project management companies, as the case may be.</p>

            <p>The term "Unit" is defined as a flat, shop, office, warehouse, floor, whole or part of a land plot, town
                house, or independent house that constitutes part of Jointly Owned Real Property and is intended for
                residential, commercial, industrial, or any other use.</p>

            <p>Under Article 49 of Law No. 6,<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="footnoteback1">[1]</a></sup> all rights and
                obligations of Owners' Associations which arose before the effective date of that Law had to be
                transferred to the Management Entities. The Management Entity will, therefore, supersede the Owners'
                Associations in the business of managing the Jointly Owned Real Property, including Units.</p>

            <h3>Owners' Associations - VAT deregistration</h3>
            <p>On the basis that all of the Owners' Associations' rights and obligations were transferred to Management
                Entities, the Owners' Associations no longer make any taxable supplies.</p>

            <p>According to Article 21(1) of the Decree-Law,<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup> a
                registrant shall apply for tax deregistration if he stops making taxable supplies.</p>

            <p>Article 14(2) of the Executive Regulation<sup><a href="#footnote3" id="footnoteback3">[3]</a></sup>
                requires that a registrant applies for deregistration within 20 business days from the date the
                registrant stops making taxable supplies or where the value of taxable supplies made over the past 12
                months is less than AED 187,500.</p>

            <p>Based on the above, VAT registered Dubai Owners' Associations were required to apply for deregistration
                no later than 4 December 2019.</p>

            <p>Any VAT registered Owners' Association that failed to apply for VAT deregistration within 20 business
                days from the date it stopped making taxable supplies is liable for an administrative penalty under
                Article 25(1)(d) of the Tax Procedures Law.<sup><a href="#footnote4" id="footnoteback4">[4]</a></sup>
                According to Table 1 &ndash; Penalty 4 of the Appendix to Cabinet Resolution 40, the administrative penalty
                for failing to submit a deregistration application within the prescribed period is AED 10,000.</p>

            <h3>Management Entities - Accounting for VAT</h3>
            <p>For VAT purposes, the Management Entity is not regarded as an agent who is just managing the building on
                behalf of the owners of the units but, as a result of Law No. 6, as the person supplying goods and
                services to the owners of the units.</p>

            <p>The management of a Jointly Owned Real Property constitutes a taxable supply of services, which is
                subject to 5% VAT, regardless of whether there are limitations on the use of service charges collected.
            </p>

            <p>As a registrant making taxable supplies, the Management Entity, under Article 65(1) of the
                Decree-Law<sup><a href="#footnote5" id="footnoteback5">[5]</a></sup> is required to issue valid tax
                invoices to the recipients of these supplies.</p>

            <p>If the Management Entity fails to issue valid tax invoices and tax credit notes (where applicable), the
                Management Entity would be liable for administrative penalties, regardless of whether the Management
                Entity issued the invalid documents or whether the documents were issued via any other third party
                system.</p>

            <p>Table 3 of the Appendix to Cabinet Resolution 40<sup><a href="#footnote6"
                        id="footnoteback6">[6]</a></sup> states that the administrative penalty for failing to issue
                valid tax invoices and tax credit notes is AED 5,000 per document. It is, therefore, highly recommended
                to review the format and content of tax invoices and tax credit notes issued, including the templates
                used by a third-party system issuing these documents on behalf of the Management Entity.</p>

            <p>The Management Entity is required to report the amounts received (in the form of service charges or
                otherwise) and the related VAT amount in Box 1b of its VAT return.</p>

            <p>The Management Entity is entitled, under Article 54(1)(a) of the Decree-Law,<sup><a href="#footnote7"
                        id="footnoteback7">[7]</a></sup> to recover VAT paid in respect of goods and services acquired
                to manage the Jointly Owned Real Property, provided the it obtains and retains valid tax invoices
                addressed to the Management Entity.</p>

            <p>According to Article 25(1)(j) of the Tax Procedures Law,<sup><a href="#footnote8"
                        id="footnoteback8">[8]</a></sup> the Management Entity, as a VAT registrant, is liable for any
                penalties which may arise as a result of submitting incorrect tax returns, including instances where VAT
                was not declared on service fees charged to owners.</p>

            <p>According to Table 1 &ndash; Penalty 10 of the Appendix to Cabinet Resolution 40,<sup><a href="#footnote9"
                        id="footnoteback9">[9]</a></sup> two penalties apply in this case; that is a fixed penalty (AED
                3,000 for the first time and AED 5,000 in the case of repetition) and a percentage-based penalty if the
                Management Entity enjoyed a tax benefit as a result of submitting an incorrect return. If the incorrect
                tax return resulted in unpaid tax due, Penalty 9<sup><a href="#footnote10"
                        id="footnoteback10">[10]</a></sup> may also apply.</p>
