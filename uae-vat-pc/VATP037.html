                <p>Article 3 of the Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&quot;Executive Regulation&quot;) has been amended by Cabinet decision No. 99 of 2022, which introduced a new provision.</p>
                <p>Article 3(2) of the amended Executive Regulation states that the functions of a member of a Board of Directors (hereafter referred to as &quot;Director&quot;), performed by a natural person, appointed as a Director, for any Government entity or private sector establishment, shall not be considered as a supply of services.</p>
                <p>The new provision takes effect as from 1 January 2023.</p>
                <p>This Public Clarification provides guidance on how to apply the new provision and determine the resulting VAT obligations prior and post the date of 1 January 2023 on concerned natural persons.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>With effect from 1 January 2023, the performance of a Director&apos;s function, by a natural person and for a remuneration (monetary or in kind), on a Board of Directors of any government or private sector entity, shall not be considered to be a supply of services for VAT purposes.</p>
                <p>Prior to 1 January 2023, the general rule was that services provided by Directors, whether the function was performed by a natural person or a legal person, were considered to be services for VAT purposes.</p>
                <p>These supplies of services were taxable where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>the Director performed the services on a regular, ongoing, and independent basis, and</p></li>
                    <li><p>the total value of taxable supplies and imports made by the Director, not limited to but also including the Director services, exceeded the mandatory registration threshold.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
                <h4>General</h4>
                <p>For the provision of Directors&apos; services not to be considered as a supply of services for VAT purposes according to the amended Executive Regulation, the following conditions must be met:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The services are provided by a natural person.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The person is appointed as a director on a Board of any government entity or private sector establishment.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Natural Person</h4>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Only Director Services by Natural Persons</h3>
                <p>Only Director services performed by natural persons, whether resident in the UAE or not, can be excluded from the qualification of &quot;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&quot;.</p>
                <p>This amendment does not extend to a legal person, whether private or public, who may delegate in its own name a natural person to act as Director.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Board of Directors</h3>
                <p>Only Director services performed as Director on a Board of Directors of a government entity or a private establishment can be excluded from the qualification of &quot;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&quot;. For clarity, this exclusion extends to services performed as a member of a committee derived from the same Board on which the Director serves.</p>
                <p>Other services provided by the member, are considered to be supplies of services for VAT purposes and may be taxable subject to meeting conditions for taxable supplies as stated in the VAT legislation.<sup>1</sup></p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Capacity as Director</h3>
                <p>Only the services performed in the formal capacity as Director can be excluded from the qualification of &quot;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&quot;.</p>
                <p>For example, free-lance services rendered by a third-party natural person who is not a Director during the meetings of a Board of Directors or any committee derived therefrom are considered to be supplies of services for VAT purposes and will be taxable subject to meeting other conditions.</p>
                <p>In case the services are performed by Directors who are not resident in the UAE, these services will evidently also be excluded from the qualification of &quot;supply of services for UAE VAT purposes&quot;. There will be no application of the reverse charge mechanism or need for the natural person to register in the UAE for VAT purposes.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Transitional Rules</h3>
                <p>Natural persons performing the function(s) of Director on a Board of Directors, as defined above, must review their tax obligations for the period both prior to and from 1 January 2023.</p>
                <p>The Date of Supply is governed by Articles 25<sup>2</sup> and 26<sup>3</sup> of the Executive Regulation. The rules laid down in these Articles will determine whether the performance of the function is deemed to take place before or from 1 January 2023.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h4>Examples for Guidance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The natural person performs the function of Director for the calendar year 2022 whereby fees from services to the Board, and any committee derived therefrom, for the year were determined and known with effect from 1 January 2022. No payments were released to the natural person during 2022 and no Tax invoices were issued.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In this scenario, and in accordance with Article 25 Decree-Law, the date of supply will be the date of actual completion of the services, and the Director&rsquo;s services will fall within the scope of the UAE VAT legislation as a supply of services, regardless of whether payment was made in 2023 or not.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The natural person is appointed as Director for 2 consecutive calendar years, i.e., 2022 and 2023. Fees for services to the Board, and any committee derived therefrom, are fixed and known from the start of 2022 and automated payments are made on the first business day after the end of each calendar quarter (1 April 2022, 1 July 2022, 3 October 2022, 2 January 2023, 3 April 2023, 3 July 2023, 2 October 2023 and 2 January 2024). It is also agreed between the Director and the entity that the Director issues his/her tax invoice after receipt of the payment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The scenario at hand covers continuous Director services for 2 calendar years and with contractually agreed periodic payments. In accordance with Article 26 of the Decree-Law, the date of supply of services for any contract that includes periodic payments or consecutive invoices shall be the earliest of any of the following dates:
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>The date of issuance of any tax invoice.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The date payment is due as specified on the tax invoice.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The date of receipt of payment.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The date of expiration of one year from the date the goods or services were provided.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>The date of supply shall be determined according to Article 26(1)(c) of the Decree-Law, i.e. the date of receipt of payment, being the earliest of the dates mentioned for the scenario at hand.</p></li>
                </ul>
