                <h3>Issue</h3>
                <p>VAT is a tax on supplies of goods and services.  
                    Therefore, no VAT is due if no supply takes place. 
                    As part of business arrangements, businesses will 
                    often make payments to compensate each other 
                    for any loss, omissions or other wrongdoings.  A 
                    question arises whether VAT is due on such 
                    payments.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Where a payment is not consideration for supply, 
                    no VAT is due on the payment.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
                <p>Under Article 2 of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 
                    2017 on Value Added Tax (&quot;VAT Law&quot;), VAT is 
                    imposed, among other things, on taxable supplies 
                    of goods and services.</p>
                
                <p>&quot;Taxable supply&quot; is defined in Article 1 of the VAT 
                    Law as a &quot;supply of goods or services for a 
                    consideration by a person conducting business in 
                    the State, and does not include exempt supply&quot;.</p>
                
                <p>As a consequence, in order for an obligation to 
                    charge VAT to arise, there must be a supply of 
                    goods or services. If any payment does not relate 
                    to a supply of goods or services then the payment 
                    is not subject to VAT.</p>
            
                <p>The question of whether or not a payment is 
                    consideration for a supply is the matter of fact.  
                    Typically, this requires the taxpayer to consider 
                    the underlying arrangements that give rise to the 
                    payment in order to determine whether the payee 
                    has provided anything in return for the payment.</p>
            
                <p>Below, a number of situations are considered 
                    where a payment may or may not be treated as 
                    being consideration for a supply of goods or 
                    services. It should be noted that the purpose of 
                    the discussion is not to provide answers for all 
                    types of payments that might be made in such 
                    situations, but to give an example of principles 
                    that should be used in determining whether VAT 
                    should be due on compensation-type payments.</p>

                <h3>A contractual payment to compensate for loss</h3>
                <p>An example of such a compensatory payment 
                    are &quot;liquidated damages&quot;. Liquidated 
                    damages are predetermined amounts that 
                    parties to an agreement designate during the 
                    formation of the agreement for the injured 
                    party to collect as compensation upon a 
                    specific breach – for example, for an early 
                    termination of a contract or a late 
                    performance. The purpose of such payments 
                    is not to provide consideration for a supply 
                    of goods or services but to compensate the 
                    affected party for a loss in income. As such, 
                    these payments fall outside the scope of 
                    VAT.</p>

                    <p>That does not, however, include where a 
                        contract allows a hotel guest to cancel a 
                        booking in return for a cancellation charge, as 
                        such charges are considered a cessation of a 
                        right, which are a supply of services and hence 
                        subject to VAT.  This is regardless of whether 
                        the hotel room remains available to the guest 
                        or not</p>

                <h3>A payment to settle a dispute</h3>
                <p>Where a dispute is settled (e.g. in or out of court) and a payment is awarded 
                    to a party, it is necessary to consider the reason behind the 
                    payment in order to determine the VAT treatment.</p>
            
                <div class="example">
                    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Where a payment is to enforce a contractual term, the payment is 
                                consideration for the contractual supply to which it relates.  
                                For example, where a dispute regarding a price of goods is settled 
                                by requiring a contractual recipient of the goods to make a 
                                payment for these goods, the payment will be consideration 
                                for the supply of the goods and therefore subject to VAT.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Where a payment is in the nature of damages or compensation 
                                for any loss suffered by a party, the payment is not 
                                consideration for any supply and is outside the scope of VAT.  
                                For example, a payment for loss of earnings or a payment of 
                                interest in respect of a late payment of contractual consideration 
                                would not be a consideration for any supply.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Where a payment is in return for granting a right then the 
                                payment is consideration for the supply of the right and may be 
                                subject to VAT. For example, a person may agree to allow another 
                                person to use its property (including intellectual property) in return 
                                for a payment, the payment is consideration for the supply of 
                                the right to use the property.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>A fine or penalty</h3>
                <p>A fine or penalty charge may be imposed for contravening terms of an agreement, 
                    performing an unlawful act or otherwise be imposed, usually by government 
                    bodies, for breaches of statutory obligations. True fines and penalties are not 
                    consideration for any supply and therefore outside the scope of VAT.</p>
            
                <div class="example">
                    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>A contract may stipulate that a party must make a payment if it breaches 
                                a term of the contract. The payment made as a result of a breach of a 
                                contract is in the nature of damages and therefore also outside the 
                                scope of VAT.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A fine or penalty may be imposed by a government authority for an 
                                unlawful act – for example, a speeding fine or fine for 
                                incorrect parking. The purpose of such 
                                fines is to punish the wrongdoer for the 
                                act and the party imposing the penalty is 
                                not making any supply in respect of the 
                                payment. Therefore, no VAT is due on 
                                such fines and penalties.</p>

                <h3>Payment for damaged goods</h3>
                <p>Where a person has damaged or lost goods 
                    belonging to another person (for example, 
                    damaging a leased car), it may be required to 
                    make a payment to compensate for the 
                    damage or loss. Where the payment is 
                    compensation and for breaching pre-existing 
                    terms of a contract, it is unlikely to be 
                    consideration for a supply and therefore 
                    would be outside the scope of VAT.</p>
            
                <p>In other circumstances, there is likely to be 
                    consideration for a supply – for example, 
                    where a customer breaks a good and is 
                    obliged to take title to it, the payment the 
                    customer makes would represent 
                    consideration for a supply of goods, and so 
                    would be subject to VAT.</p>

                <h3>Holistic Analysis</h3>
                <p>In summary, in determining whether or not a 
                    payment is consideration for any supply, it is 
                    necessary to consider the contractual and legal 
                    arrangements in full to determine the reason for 
                    the payment. Thus, it may be necessary to 
                    consider whether:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The payment is consideration for any 
                            previously agreed goods or services;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The payment is consideration for any newly 
                            created supply of goods or services;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The purpose of the payment is to adjust a 
                            previously agreed consideration for a supply;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A party is granting a right to another party in 
                            return for a payment;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A party is promising not to exercise a right in 
                            return for a payment;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A party is giving something up in return for a 
                            payment.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>In considering whether a payment is consideration 
                    for a supply or is in the nature of compensation, it 
                    is important to ignore the labels or titles the 
                    parties give to a payment. For example, a 
                    description of an administrative payment as a 
                    &quot;penalty&quot; or a &quot;compensation&quot; will not prevent 
                    the nature of the payment from being 
                    consideration for a supply.</p>
