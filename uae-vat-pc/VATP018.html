      <h3>VAT Public Clarification</h3>
      <h3>Change in the permitted use of a building</h3>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>The supply of a building may be standard-rated, zero-rated, or exempt from VAT, depending on the nature of
          the building and the permitted use thereof at the date of supply.</p>
        <p>Since VAT is a transaction-based tax, the VAT treatment shall be determined independently at each date of
          supply.</p>
        <p>This Public Clarification clarifies the VAT treatment of the sale of a building and the subsequent use
          thereof by the purchaser.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The sale of a building constitutes the supply of a single indivisible good at the date of supply. If the
          purchaser subsequently changes the permitted use of the building, it does not impact the VAT treatment of the
          preceding sale.</p>
        <p>Consequently, where a building was sold as a serviced/hotel apartment and the purchaser subsequently changes
          the permitted use to residential use only, the preceding sale will remain subject to 5% VAT. The purchaser
          should not account for VAT on the subsequent exempt supply.</p>
        <p>If a building was sold as a residential building but the permitted use is subsequently changed to use as a
          serviced/hotel apartment, the VAT treatment of the original sale will remain the same, i.e., exempt from VAT,
          except if it was the first supply of the building, in which case the supply may be zero-rated. After the
          permitted use is changed, the purchaser must account for 5% VAT on the supply of the building to a third party
          if the purchaser is a Taxable Person.</p>

        <h3>Detailed Discussion</h3>

        <h4>Legislative Background</h4>
        <p>In this clarification, Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax is referred to as &ldquo;Decree-Law&rdquo; and
          Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value
          Added Tax is referred to as &ldquo;Executive Regulations&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>According to Article 2, read with Article 3 of the Decree-Law, 5% VAT shall be imposed on every taxable
          supply made in the UAE by a Taxable Person unless the supply qualifies for zero-rating or exemption under the
          provisions of Title Six of the Decree-Law. The term &apos;Taxable Person&apos; is defined in Article 1 of the Decree-Law
          as any person who is, or is required to be, registered for VAT in the UAE.</p>

        <p>Article 45(9) of the Decree-Law allows the first supply of a residential building within three years of
          completion to be zero-rated irrespective of whether the building is sold or leased, and whether in part or as
          a whole.</p>

        <p>Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law exempts the supply of residential buildings through sale or lease unless the
          supply qualifies for zero-rating under Article 45(9) and 45(11). Article 43(1) of the Executive Regulations
          states that the supply of residential buildings is exempt—unless zero-rated—where the lease is more than six
          months or the tenant of the property is a holder of an ID card issued by the Federal Authority for Identity
          and Citizenship.</p>

        <p>Article 37(1) of the Executive Regulations defines the term &apos;residential building&apos; to include any building or
          part of a building that the person occupies, or that it can be foreseen that a person will occupy, as their
          principal place of residence.</p>

        <p>Article 37(2) of the Executive Regulations explicitly excludes the following from the definition of
          &apos;residential building&apos;:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><em>Sub-clause (b) - </em>Any building that is used as a hotel, motel, bed and breakfast establishment, or hospital of the like.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Subclause (c) - </em>A hotel apartment for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since the sale of a building is an indivisible supply of a good, the general date of supply rule, as set out
          in Article 25 of the Decree-Law will apply. That is, the date of supply is the earlier of the date:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Ownership of the building is transferred to the purchaser (as evidenced by the registration at the
              relevant government entity);</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>On which the purchaser took possession of the building;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Payment was received in respect of the supply of the building;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A Tax Invoice was issued in respect of the supply of the building.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the case of a lease with either periodic payments or consecutive invoices, the special date of supply
          rules set out in Article 26 of the Decree-Law will apply. That is, the date of supply would be the earlier of
          the date:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Any Tax Invoice is issued in respect of the lease of the building;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Payment is received in respect of the lease.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Special Date of Supply Rules (Lease)</h4>
        <p>In case of a lease with periodic payments or consecutive invoices, Article 26 of the Decree-Law applies. The
          date of supply is the earlier of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Any Tax Invoice is issued in respect of the lease of the building;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Any payment is due as shown on the Tax Invoice;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Payment is received in respect of the lease of the building; or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>12 months lapse from the date the right to use the building was provided to the lessee.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Accounting for VAT on Instalments</h4>
        <p>Article 19 of the Executive Regulations states that where VAT becomes due due to a payment or tax invoice, it
          is only due to the extent of the payment or the amount stated on the tax invoice. VAT can be accounted for as
          the amounts are billed or paid.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Sale of a Building</h3>
        <p>In the context of this clarification, the supply of an apartment or any unit within a building is treated as
          the supply of a &ldquo;building&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>The sale of a building is a single indivisible supply on the date of supply as per Article 25 of the
          Decree-Law. If the sale agreement allows for multiple instalments, VAT is due only to the extent of the actual
          amount paid or billed, as per Article 19 of the Executive Regulations.</p>

        <p>As the VAT treatment of the sale crystalizes on the date of supply:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Any change in use before the date of supply is disregarded — only the permitted use at the date of supply
              is considered.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Any subsequent change in permitted use will not impact the VAT treatment of the original sale.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Purchaser &ndash; Acquisition and Subsequent Supply of a Residential Building</h3>
        <p>If the seller sold a residential building to a purchaser who then leases or sells it to a third party, two
          separate supplies occur:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>First supply:</strong> The seller supplies the residential building to the buyer on the date of
              supply. If this is the first supply within 3 years of completion, the supply may be zero-rated. Otherwise,
              it may be exempt under Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Second supply:</strong> The purchaser leases or sells the building as a principal place of
              residence to a third party. This supply is exempt under Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The purchaser may amend the use of the building to lease or sell it as a serviced or hotel apartment to a
              third party. This supply is subject to 5% VAT if the purchaser (the owner) is a Taxable Person (i.e.,
              registered or required to register for VAT).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Purchaser &ndash; Acquisition of a Non-Residential Building and Subsequent Supply</h3>
        <p>A non-residential building refers to any building not falling within the definition of a &apos;residential
          building&apos;, such as hotel or serviced apartments.</p>

        <p>If the seller sold a non-residential building to a purchaser who subsequently leases or sells it to a third
          party, two separate supplies occur:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>First supply:</strong> The seller supplies the building to the buyer on the date of supply as
              determined under the general rules. This supply is subject to 5% VAT if the seller is a Taxable Person.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Second supply:</strong> The purchaser amends the permitted use and leases or sells the building
              to
              a third party as a principal residence (i.e., as a &apos;residential building&apos;). This supply is exempt under
              Article 46(2) of the Decree-Law; or</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The purchaser leases or sells the building as a serviced/hotel apartment to a third party. This supply is
              subject to 5% VAT if the purchaser (the owner of the building) is a Taxable Person.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The VAT treatment of the sale of a building is independent from the purchaser's subsequent supply. Therefore,
          it remains the same regardless of whether the purchaser later amends the permitted use to lease or sell the
          building as a residential unit or hotel/serviced apartment.</p>
