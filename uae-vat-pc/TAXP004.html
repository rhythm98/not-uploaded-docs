            <h3>Issue</h3>

            <p>On 28 April 2021, the Cabinet issued Decision No. 49 of 2021 on Amending some Provisions of Cabinet
                Decision No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws in the UAE ("Cabinet
                Decision No. 49 of 2021")<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="footnoteback1">[1]</a></sup>. Cabinet Decision
                No. 49 of 2021 amended some of the administrative penalties applicable to certain violations and allowed
                for a redetermination of some of the penalties already imposed.</p>

            <p>On 30 December 2021, Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 was amended by Cabinet Decision No. 108 of 2021 on
                the Amendment of Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws
                in the UAE ("Cabinet Decision No. 108 of 2021"), with effect from 1 January 2022.</p>

            <p>Cabinet Decision No. 108 of 2021 amends the timelines provided to benefit from the concessionary measures
                provided in the form of redetermination of administrative penalties.</p>

            <p>This Public Clarification provides detailed information on the redetermination of some of the penalties
                already imposed.</p>

            <p>Details relating to the amendments to administrative penalties in accordance with the First Article of
                Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 have been discussed in the Tax Procedures Public Clarification
                <i>"TAXP001 - Amendments to the Penalties Regime"</i>, available on the FTA's website.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>

            <p>Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 provides for the ability to redetermine penalties imposed before its
                effective date (i.e. before 28 June 2021) where the penalties were imposed according to Cabinet Decision
                No. 40 of 2017 and certain conditions are met. This decision is applicable on all administrative
                penalties imposed as per Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 whether in respect of tax procedures, VAT or
                Excise Tax.</p>

            <p>Cabinet Decision No. 108 of 2021 extends the period within which a registrant can benefit from the
                penalty redetermination.</p>

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>

            <p><i>Background</i></p>

            <p>The UAE introduced Excise Tax and VAT with effect from 1 October 2017 and 1 January 2018, respectively.
            </p>

            <p>In order to offer consistency in the administration of different taxes, a set of common tax procedures
                concerning the rights and obligations of the FTA and taxpayers has been developed and prescribed in the
                Federal tax procedures legislation, including in Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures ("FTP
                Law"). These Federal tax procedures apply to all Federal taxes under the jurisdiction of the FTA.</p>

            <p>Article 25 of the FTP Law<sup><a href="#footnote2" id="footnoteback2">[2]</a></sup> specifies a number of
                violations which are subject to administrative penalties. This Article also directs the Cabinet to issue
                a decision that specifies administrative penalties for each of the violations listed in the Article, on
                condition that each such penalty cannot be less than AED 500 for any violation and cannot exceed three
                times the amount of tax in respect of which the penalty was levied.</p>

            <p>The specific administrative penalties for each violation are prescribed in the Cabinet Decision No. 40 of
                2017, which was issued on 24 September 2017. These penalties have been applied to violations since the
                introduction of the VAT and Excise Taxes.</p>

            <p>On 28 April 2021, the Cabinet has issued the Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021, which amends some of the
                administrative penalties applicable on the violations stated in Tables appended to Cabinet Decision No.
                40 of 2017. Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 in its Third Article also included concessionary measures in
                respect of the administrative penalties imposed on them prior to the effective date of Cabinet Decision
                No. 49 of 2021.</p>

            <p>Cabinet Decision No. 108 of 2021, replaces the Third Article<sup><a href="#footnote3"
                        id="footnoteback3">[3]</a></sup> of Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 to provide an extended
                timeframe for registrants to benefit from this measure. This Public Clarification discusses these
                measures in detail.</p>

            <p><i>Redetermination of Administrative Penalties Imposed Prior to 28 June 2021</i></p>

            <p>As a concessionary measure aimed to help businesses, Cabinet Decision No. 49 of 2021 and Cabinet Decision
                No 108 of 2021 give the FTA ability to redetermine the amounts of unsettled payable administrative
                penalties, which were imposed on registrants on the basis of the penalty rules listed in Cabinet
                Decision No. 40 of 2017.</p>

            <p>To benefit from the redetermination, all of the following conditions have to be met:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Any of the administrative penalties set out in Cabinet Decision No. 40 of 2017 have been imposed
                        on the person before 28 June 2021;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The person has not settled all the administrative penalties imposed on the Person as per Cabinet
                        Decision No. 40 of 2017 in full before 28 June 2021.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The taxable person has undertaken any of the following:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <p>Settling the following amounts by 31 December 2021:</p>
                            <ul class="dashed">
                                <li>
                                    <p>All payable tax up to 31 December 2021, regardless of whether such tax was
                                        payable before or after 28 June 2021; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>30% of the total unsettled administrative penalties referenced above which were
                                        imposed before 28 June 2021.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Settling the following amounts by 31 December 2022:</p>
                            <ul class="dashed">
                                <li>
                                    <p>All payable tax up to 31 December 2022, regardless of whether such tax was
                                        payable before or after 28 June 2021; and</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>30% of the total unsettled administrative penalties referenced above which were
                                        imposed before 28 June 2021.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>For completeness, please note that, in this context, settlement means that the FTA must have received the
                relevant amounts.</p>

            <p>Where the above conditions are met, the FTA will, redetermine the amount of administrative penalties
                payable and not settled by 28 June 2021, to equal 30% of that unsettled part. Hence, the person shall
                not be required to pay the remaining part (i.e. 70%).</p>

            <p><i>Redetermination of Penalties on the Registrant's Account</i></p>

            <p>Upon satisfying the conditions prescribed above, the FTA will reflect the redetermined penalty on the
                qualifying registrant's e-Services account.</p>

            <p>Where the registrant satisfied the conditions by 31 December 2021, the FTA will redetermine the penalty
                within 30 business days from 31 December 2021.</p>

            <p>However, where the conditions were not satisfied on 31 December 2021 but were satisfied on 31 December
                2022, the FTA will redetermine the penalty within 30 business days from 31 December 2022.</p>

            <p><i>Examples</i></p>

            <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
                At beginning of April 2021, a penalty of AED 12,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet Decision
                No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 2,000 of this penalty on 15 April 2021. On 28 June 2021, AED
                10,000 penalties remain unsettled. The Registrant settled all payable tax including that relating to the
                last return due in 2021 and 30% of the penalties unsettled (i.e. AED 3,000) by 31 December 2021. In this
                case, the Registrant qualified for redetermination, and the FTA will redetermine the penalty within 30
                business days from 31 December 2021. Consequently, the Registrant will no longer be required to pay the
                remaining AED 7,000 of the administrative penalties, and the administrative penalty imposed before 28
                June 2021 shall equal AED 3,000 that was already settled by the Registrant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
                At beginning of April 2021, a penalty of AED 12,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet Decision
                No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 2,000 of this penalty on 15 April 2021. On 28 June 2021, AED
                10,000 penalties remain unsettled. The Registrant settled 30% of the penalties unsettled (i.e. AED
                3,000) but did not settle all payable tax. In this case, the Registrant does not qualify for
                redetermination as it has not settled all payable tax. Consequently, the Registrant is still required to
                pay the remaining AED 7,000 of the administrative penalties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br>
                In December 2019, an administrative penalty of AED 15,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet
                Decision No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 1,000 of this penalty on 11 November 2020. On 28
                June 2021, AED 14,000 penalties remained unsettled. The Registrant settled all payable tax including the
                tax that related to the last return due in 2021 and 10% of the penalties unsettled (i.e. AED 1,400) by
                31 December 2021. In this case, the Registrant did not qualify for the redetermination by 31 December
                2021 as less than 30% of the outstanding penalties were paid. However, the Registrant settles the
                remainder of the 30% of the penalties imposed before 28 June 2021 on 25 March 2022 (i.e. AED 2,800). The
                Registrant also settles all payable tax including that relating to the last return due in 2022. Hence,
                the Registrant qualifies for the redetermination, and the FTA will redetermine the penalty within 30
                business days from 31 December 2022. Consequently, the Registrant will no longer be required to pay the
                remaining AED 9,800 of the administrative penalties, as the re-determined administrative penalty which
                was imposed before 28 June 2021 shall equal AED 4,200, and this amount was already settled by the
                Registrant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 4:</strong><br>
                In May 2020, an administrative penalty of AED 24,000 was imposed on a Registrant as per Cabinet Decision
                No. 40 of 2017. The Registrant settled AED 4,000 of this penalty on 21 September 2020. On 28 June 2021,
                AED 20,000 penalties remain unsettled. The Registrant did not settle all payable tax in 2021 nor have
                the Registrant settled 30% of the penalties by 31 December 2021. In this case, the Registrant did not
                qualify for the redetermination by 31 December 2021. However, the Registrant settles, within 2022, all
                payable tax including that relating to the last return due in 2022 and 30% of the penalties imposed
                before 28 June 2021 on 15 July 2022 (i.e. AED 6,000). Hence, the Registrant qualifies for the
                redetermination, and the FTA will redetermine the penalty within 30 business days from 31 December 2022.
                Consequently, the Registrant will no longer be required to pay the remaining AED 14,000 of the
                administrative penalties, as the re-determined administrative penalty which was imposed before 28 June
                2021 shall equal AED 6,000, and this amount was already settled by the Registrant.</p>

                data to the registrants' e-Services accounts. Registrants are be able to view further information
