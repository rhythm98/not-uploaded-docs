            <li>
                <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Article 1 of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax (&quot;VAT Law&quot;) defines consideration as &quot;all that is received or expected to be received for the supply of Goods or Services, whether in money or other acceptable forms of payment&quot;.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A taxable person may receive payments in the nature of donations, grants, and sponsorships from third parties including but not limited to employees, customers, suppliers, etc. To determine whether these are subject to VAT, it must be identified whether such payments are consideration for taxable supplies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This Public Clarification discusses the principles that must be applied to ascertain the taxability of donations, grants, and sponsorships.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The VAT treatment of donations, grants, and sponsorships depends on whether the donor, grantor, or sponsor has received any benefit in return. If a benefit is received, VAT implications apply. If not, the payments are outside the scope of VAT and not considered consideration for a supply.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The use of the terms &quot;donation&quot;, &quot;sponsorship&quot;, and &quot;grant&quot; alone does not determine the VAT treatment. Businesses must evaluate all relevant facts and circumstances.</p>
            </li>

        <h4>Detailed Discussion</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>VAT implications arise only where there is an underlying taxable supply. Despite the wide definition of &quot;consideration&quot;, VAT applies only if the payment relates to a taxable supply. It must be assessed whether the donor, grantor, or sponsor receives any benefit in the form of a supply. The benefit must be closely linked to the payment for VAT to apply.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h4>Donations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a donation is given without any express or implied benefit, it is not a consideration for a supply and is outside the scope of VAT. The donation must be unconditional and unrestricted. The following principles help determine this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Does the donor receive any benefit in return for the donation?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Does any person other than the donor receive any benefit in return for the donation?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Is there any condition stating that the donation must be used in a specific way that benefits the donor or another person?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Is there any written or oral agreement between the parties? If yes, what does the agreement stipulate?</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clarification on Donations, Sponsorships, and Grants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Example – Donations:</strong> If a business donates money to a hospital and in return the hospital provides space for marketing or product display, the donation is treated as consideration for a taxable supply and attracts VAT.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Sponsorships:</strong> Sponsorships are generally subject to VAT, as the recipient often provides something in return to the sponsor. This may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Displaying the sponsor’s logo</p></li>
                    <li><p>Allowing use of the recipient’s name</p></li>
                    <li><p>Providing entertainment services</p></li>
                    <li><p>Hosting the sponsor at restaurants</p></li>
                    <li><p>Providing tickets or access to events</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>All facts and circumstances must be considered holistically to determine the VAT treatment.</p>
                <p><strong>Example – Sponsorship:</strong> A business agrees to sponsor AED 100,000 for a football match in exchange for logo placement at the stadium entrance. This sponsorship is subject to VAT as there is a benefit provided in return.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Grants:</strong> Similar to donations and sponsorships, VAT treatment of grants depends on whether any benefit is received by the grantor in return.</p>
                <p>If no benefit is received, the grant is outside the scope of VAT. However, if the grantor does receive a benefit, the grant is subject to VAT.</p>
                <p><strong>Example – Grant:</strong> A person gives a grant to a university to conduct research, and the results of the research will be used in the grantor’s business. This grant is subject to VAT as it provides a direct benefit to the grantor.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Donations, Sponsorships, and Grants in the Form of Goods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>There may be cases where donations, sponsorships, and grants are given in the form of goods. In such cases, deemed supply provisions may apply under the UAE VAT Law.</p>
