                <h3>Issue</h3>
                <p>With the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies, the question of tax treatment of crypto currency mining has become increasingly relevant.</p>
                <p>In a case of proof of work, a person can mine crypto currency for his own account, or for someone’s account by providing access to excess computational power or data farms.</p>
                <p>For purposes of this public clarification, “crypto currencies” are a form of virtual assets.1 Examples of crypto currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum (Classic), and other currencies that are based on proof of work.</p>
                <p>This Public Clarification clarifies the VAT treatment of crypto currency mining using the proof-of-work mechanism.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Crypto currency mining by a person2 for his own account is not a taxable supply3 and falls outside the scope of VAT.</p>
                <p>Mining crypto currency on behalf of another person, i.e. supplying computational power, is considered to be a taxable supply of services.</p>
                <p>Input tax incurred on expenses by a person mining for his own account would not be recoverable as the person would not be incurring these expenses to make a taxable supply.</p>
                <p>However, input tax incurred by a registrant4 mining on behalf of another person may be recovered to the extent that the input tax is incurred to make a taxable supply.</p>

                <h3>Detailed analysis</h3>
                <h4>Mining of crypto currency</h4>
                <p>Mining of crypto currency is the process where specialised computers, also known as mining rigs, validate blockchain transactions for a specific crypto currency, for which a reward may be received for the contribution of computational power.</p>
                <p>A person can mine crypto currency for himself or contract with another person to mine on their behalf.</p>
                <p>If the attempt to validate the crypto currency’s blockchain transaction is successful, and the person is the first to solve the cryptographic equation, the person receives a reward for their contribution.</p>
                <p>This reward is, generally, provided in the form of a proportional share of crypto currency that is paid out by the network for the person’s proportional share of computational power that has been contributed to the network.</p>
                <p>The reward is not directly received from persons on the crypto currency’s network for the mining activities, but is allocated from the network.</p>
            
                <h4>Mining crypto for a person’s own account</h4>
                <p>Generally, taxable supplies of goods and services made by a taxable person5 in the UAE are subject to 5% VAT unless an exemption or zero-rating applies.</p>
                <p>A person undertaking mining activities for his own account, contributes his computational power to the network and does not contribute such computational power to any identifiable recipient.</p>
                <p>This contribution involves validating blockchain transactions, and the person may only be rewarded if he is the first to successfully solve the cryptographic equation.</p>
                <p>A person is not guaranteed a reward if he successfully solves the cryptographic equation, as the reward does not solely depend on the person solving the equation, but also on being the first to solve it.</p>
                <p>As such, there is no close nexus between the mining activity conducted by the miner and the reward (e.g. mined tokens) received. Further, there is no identifiable recipient to whom the mining activities are provided.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Mining services supplied</h3>
                <p>A person mining cryptocurrency on behalf of another person for a fee is considered to make a supply of services.7</p>
                <p>As there is an identifiable recipient for the activity, and the person performing the mining on another person’s behalf receives a consideration from his customer, the mining activities performed constitute a taxable supply of services.8</p>
                <p>If the service is supplied by a taxable person to a customer in the UAE, the supply of services will be subject to the standard rate.</p>
                <p>However, the supply may be zero-rated if it is made to a non-resident and all the requirements for zero rating under Article 31 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulation of Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax, and its amendments, (&quot;Executive Regulation&quot;) are met.9</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Mining services received</h3>
                <p>Where a UAE business receives mining services from a non-resident person such supply would be subject to VAT.</p>
                <p>If the recipient of these services is registered for VAT in the UAE, they must account for the tax using the reverse charge mechanism on these concerned services.10</p>
                <p>Conversely, if the customer is a UAE resident business and not a taxable person11, the non-resident supplier is required to register for VAT in the UAE12 and charge VAT on the services provided.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Recovery of input tax</h3>
                <p>A person mining crypto currency may incur input tax as part of his mining activities, including, for example, VAT incurred on purchases of hardware, rental of commercial real estate space, utility expenses and maintenance services.</p>
                <p>Where the person is a registrant4, the person must consider his eligibility to recover the input tax incurred.</p>
                <p>If a person is mining for his own account, the costs incurred would not be for the purpose of making taxable supplies.</p>
                <p>Consequently, as the person mining for his own account is not making a taxable supply, the input tax incurred cannot be recovered.13</p>
                <p>However, if the person acts as a service provider, and mines crypto currency on behalf of another person, the person may be eligible to recover the input tax to the extent the input tax is incurred for the purpose of making taxable supplies, provided that the relevant supporting evidence, e.g. tax 
                    invoices, are retained.<sup>13</sup>  </p>
