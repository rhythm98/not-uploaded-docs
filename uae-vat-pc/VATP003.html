            <h3>Issue</h3>
            <p>
                Labour camps and labour accommodation are
                generally areas where labourers are housed by
                their employers. They can take many different
                forms and some may provide residents with
                additional services on top of the living
                accommodation. It is therefore necessary to
                consider on a case by case basis whether labour
                accommodation is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>a residential building, and therefore
                        exempt from VAT (or zero-rated if the first
                        supply); or</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>serviced accommodation, and therefore
                        standard rated.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                There will be instances where the supply of certain
                labour accommodation shall be a supply of
                residential property, and other instances where
                the supply of certain labour accommodation shall
                be a supply of serviced accommodation. The
                distinction is important as it will affect the VAT
                liability of the supply. Suppliers are required to
                consider the extent of the additional services
                supplied along with the accommodation in order
                to determine the nature of the supply. Suppliers
                should also consider whether they are making a
                single composite supply, or whether they are
                making a mixed supply of several different
                component parts.

            <h3>Detailed discussion</h3>
            <p><i>Labour accommodation as residential property:</i></p>
            <p>
                As mentioned in Paragraph 3.5 of the Real Estate
                guide, labour accommodation will be considered
                to comprise of lodgings which are to be treated as
                residential buildings where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>the building or lodging is occupied by the
                        employees as their principal place of
                        residence;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        it is a building which is fixed to the ground and
                        which cannot be moved without being
                        damaged;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        the building has been constructed or
                        converted with lawful authority; and
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>it is not a building which is similar to a hotel,
                        motel, bed & breakfast establishment, or
                        serviced apartment for which services in
                        addition to the supply of accommodation are
                        provided.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Labour accommodation as serviced accommodation:</i></p>
            <p>
                In certain cases, residents may be provided with
                additional services on top of the living
                accommodation. In such cases, it is necessary to
                consider whether the extent of the additional
                services provided would move the supply from
                one of residential accommodation to serviced
                accommodation. Each scenario must be assessed
                on its actual facts.
            </p>
            <p><i>Services normally supplied along with residential
                accommodation:</i></p>
            <p>
                It is normal that a supplier of residential
                accommodation may provide certain services as
                ancillary to the main supply. Where those
                additional services are incidental to the main
                supply of accommodation and not provided for an
                additional fee, they should not normally cause the
                supply to become one of serviced
                accommodation. Such incidental services may
                include, but are not limited to, the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>cleaning of communal areas;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        maintenance services required for the general
                        upkeep of the property;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>pest control;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>garbage collection;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>security;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>utilities e.g. electricity, water, etc;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        access to facilities within the building for
                        residents to use themselves, e.g. launderette
                        facilities, gym, pool, prayer rooms etc.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Additional services indicating a supply of serviced accommodation:</i></p>
            <p>The additional services which may indicate that
                the supply is one of serviced accommodation,
                rather than residential accommodation, includes
                but is not limited to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>telephone and internet access;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>cleaning of the rooms, other than purely the
                        communal areas of the property;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>laundry services, including the regular
                        changing of bed linen;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>catering;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>maintenance services other than those
                        required for the general upkeep of the
                        property.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Mixed versus composite supplies:</i></p>
            <p>
                Suppliers of labour accommodation should also
                consider whether they are making a single
                composite supply (of either residential
                accommodation, or serviced accommodation
                based on the above), or whether they are making
                a mixed supply with separate component parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where a single composite supply is made, the
                entire consideration for the supply shall be subject
                to the VAT treatment of the principal component.
                Where a mixed supply is made, each component
                part must be valued and the correct VAT
                treatment applied to each component part.
            </p>
            <p>
                In accordance with Article 4 of the Cabinet
                Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive
                Regulations of the Federal Decree-Law No. 8 of
                2017 on Value Added Tax, a single composite
                supply shall exist in the following cases:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>where there is a supply of all of the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>a principal component</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>a component or components which
                                either are necessary or essential to the
                                making of the supply, including incidental
                                elements which normally accompany the
                                supply but are not of a significant part of
                                it; or do not constitute an aim in itself, but
                                are instead a better means of enjoying
                                the principal supply.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        where this is a supply which has two or more
                        elements so closely linked as to form a single
                        supply which it would be impossible or
                        unnatural to split.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Where it is considered that a single composite
                supply is being made, based on the above, the
                following facts must also be taken into account:
            </p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <p>the price of the different components of the
                        supply is not separately identified or charged
                        by the supplier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>All components of the supply are supplied by
                        a single supplier.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As a result of the above, even where it is
                considered that a single composite supply is being
                made, it shall be prevented from being treated as
                such if the various components are supplied by
                different suppliers or where the prices of each
                component are separately listed out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply charging a single price does not, however,
                automatically mean a single composite supply is
                being made e.g. if there is not an identifiable
                principal component.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where a supplier supplies more than one
                component for one price and the supply is not a
                single composite supply, then the supply of the
                components shall be treated as multiple supplies
                i.e. whether they are subject to VAT or not.
