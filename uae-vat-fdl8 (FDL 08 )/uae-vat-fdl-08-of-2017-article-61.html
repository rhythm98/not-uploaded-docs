                                <li><p>If the Tax treatment of the supply is changed due to a change in the nature of the supply.</p></li>
                                <li><p>If the previously agreed Consideration for the supply is altered for any reason whatsoever.</p></li>
                                <li><p>If the Recipient of Goods or Recipient of Services returned them to the Registrant in full or in part and the Consideration is returned in full or in part.</p></li>

                            <p>Paragraph (e) of Clause (1) of this Article shall not apply where the place of supply was treated by the supplier on the date of supply as being subject to Clause (1) of Article (27), but, as a result of a movement of the Goods, it turned out that it should have been treated as a supply place under paragraph (b/1) of Clause (3) hereof.</p>

                                <li><p>If the Registrant submits a Tax Return for the tax period during which the supply occurred and an amount was incorrectly calculated as being the amount of the output Tax due for this supply as the result of any of the cases mentioned in Clause (1) of this Article."</p></li>
