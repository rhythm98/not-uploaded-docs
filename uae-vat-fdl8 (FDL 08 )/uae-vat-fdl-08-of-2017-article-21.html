                <article>
                    <ol>
                         <li>  <p> The Registrant shall submit to the Authority an application for Tax deregistration in
                            any of the following cases:
                            <ol type="a">
                                 <li>  <p> If he ceases to make Taxable Supplies. </p> </li> 
                                 <li>  <p> If the value of the Taxable Supplies made during the period of (12) twelve
                                    consecutive months is less than the Voluntary Registration Threshold, and the
                                    case set out in Clause (2) of Article (17) of this Decree-Law is not applicable
                                    to him. </p> </li> 
                            </ol>
                         </p> </li> 
                         <li>  <p> The Authority may issue a Tax deregistration decision where it is convinced that the
                            retention of tax registration would adversely affect the tax system's integrity,
                            pursuant to the conditions and controls set forth in the Executive Regulations of this
                            Decree-Law. </p> </li> 
                         <li>  <p> The Tax deregistration shall not invalidate the Authority's right to claim any tax due
                            or administrative fines. </p> </li> 
                    </ol>
